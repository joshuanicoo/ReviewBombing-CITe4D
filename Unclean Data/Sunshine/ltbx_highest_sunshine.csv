DI NAMAN AKO IYAKIN PERO LALA NG HAGULGOL KO. when she was bleeding pucha yung puson ko parang nawawasak din. i really cannot fathom how women have to go through something so heartbreaking just because every being in her life failed her.""ang nakabuntis sakanya, tito niya"" TANGINA MAMATAY NA LAHAT NG LALAKI.why do women always have to bear the consequences, the pain, the fear, the judgement, the struggle— everything everytime a man messes up. i hope all pro-life individuals realize that there's nothing more cruel than birthing a baby no one ever wanted. why strip off a living human being off its hopes and dreams for a ""baby"" that is not even in a specific stage of gestation.Maris really did an amazing job portraying sunshine and what she's going through. i can't think of anyone who would've done better. i will forever be an advocate for woman's rights and reproductive health, and for individuals to acknowledge that that there is nothing wrong in choosing themselves; choosing your own path and chasing your dreams.""gets ko na"".

jbjamesssb,10,"dream or responsibility?Are you anti- or pro-abortion?As this film is created from a very conservative country—Christian—this is such a hot take, especially for those religious people that were also shown in the film with the use of the OB-GYN. But as someone who's pro abortion, this is a chef's kiss and an overwhelming approach but a nightmare to those who oppose it. Abortion must be legalized now, as there were too many rape victims that couldn't escape from their nightmare but a “blessing in disguise” to be treated by those who never experienced it. Actually I really have so many words to say, but I couldn't write it all down. And let's characterize the characters one by one. Maris' acting never disappointed me; she always proved why she deserved all the fame and recognition she's getting, and as for her character, she is such a loud, bold, and brave woman—deciding all things without further hesitation, though I know it may just seem impulsive, but that's what everyone would do when their only dream is at risk.Jennica's character as a sister was the purest that we all need to have; how I would love to have someone like her by my side for the rest of my life.Elijah and Xyriel's characters were under surveillance by their parents, so they feared whenever they made a single mistake. I fear I somehow saw myself in them back then.And for the overall film, the whole team deserves a well and wide recognition.",2025-12-14,8,0,watch,False

I liked that it was mostly women helping Sunshine out, because who else really knows how that feels? The film totally calls out the hypocrisy of people who judge your life without knowing the massive problems and choices you had to weigh. For me, Annika was like Sunshine's conscience or her unborn child, and all that guilt. She was the one who helped Sunshine process everything, showing that she wasn't completely alone through all of it. And Rhed's storyline makes it clear that abortion is also about healthcare, especially when the victim is a child who hasn't even figured out the real world yet. The movie shows just how impossibly hard it is to raise a child in the Philippines, starting with the hospitals. So many are just not taken care of properly, and it really exposes the corruption and terrible state of our healthcare system. We should have the final say over our own bodies, but we still need to be responsible and aware of the consequences.Fave line: “yung pangarap ko kung ano ang pangarap niya” “gets ko na”",2025-12-13,0,0,watch,True

To the bravery of every woman in the film mula kay Sunshine hanggang kay Direc, saludo talaga.I really liked how the movie focused on Sunshine’s journey, especially the guilt even when you know you’re choosing what’s better for you. The constant hesitation, the konsensya na kahit hindi ka naman talaga attached sa Catholic beliefs, mararamdaman at mararamdaman mo pa rin kahit sabihin pa ng iba na hindi naman ‘yan totoong tao pa (lowk felt validated w this one talaga as someone na nagkakaroon minsan ng contradicting opinions). It showed the cruel, harsh reality of what so many women are still experiencing, hindi lang sa Pilipinas. i also liked na hindi niya niromanticize ang ending. yes, pinili nila ang path na magbibigay sa kanila ng mas malayang future para makapagpatuloy sa mga pangarap nila, and yeah that’s a factor, but the film never made it the “reward.” It respected the nuance of their decisions, hindi pinilit na gawing moral lesson or success story. Instead, it stayed centered on women’s choices. It lets the audience truly feel the hardship and struggle behind those decisions. Her success wasn’t what validated her, and it shouldn’t be. Even if hindi ipakita yung “would’ve been” life, or the “would’ve been” anak, her choice remains valid because we all have our own pacing, our own rights to our own choices in our own lives :)to a better healthcare, esp reproductive health education and to more ph films that boldly challenge toxic filipino cultural norms :<",2025-12-10,1,0,watch,True

quittekat,10,"“Labag yan sa batas, lalong lalo nang labag na labag yan sa batas ng Diyos. Magpasalamat ka.”“Salamat po… saan?”It fucking pisses me off, these religious people and their mentality about abortion. Abortion is selfcare, it’s a choice, it’s freedom. But most importantly abortion is for someone who have had an unwanted pregnancy, especially most of the times when it’s teens. Not irresponsible ones but those who’s been raped, sexually assaulted or abused, and those who are too young to understand the concept of creating a baby. Lalo na kung wala pa silang kapasidad bumuo ng pamilya dahil nga sobrang bata pa nila at nabuntis sila ng kung sino, ang worst is relative pa nila. I’m glad mulat si Sunshine sa mga ganitong bagay. This is a sensitive topic, and good for Sunshine that she decided early on that she doesn’t want to be a mother and continue that path, no matter how much some people tried to persuade her and talk about how they can support the baby even if she didn’t want to raise it or for it to be born at all. She have dreams, dreams that are bigger than her and her having a child. Mas matured pa sya mag isip kesa sa ibang matatandang nakapaligid sa kanya. And to think na mas may sense pa yung pagpapa abort nya kesa sa buhayin yung bata because for me personally I viewed it as a trap for women like her. This is not talked about enough here in our country. Abroad, yes most of the countries had legalized abortion but for some reason our country instilled that we are not ready to have this kind of law or legalization. We are so behind and our fuckass mentality most specifically the older generation’s thinking is not ready for this kind of topic. That last scene, gets kita Sunshine. Gets na gets. And I hope more women like me and you get the point of this movie. And miraculously, sana ang mga lalaki din. Women like us are bigger than just having a baby, than just being a mother. Maybe some dreamt of it, but women like us have high hopes for our future and it’s nothing to be ashamed of. Abortion is not bad when women choose themselves and prioritize their own wellbeing. Let that sink in.

The plot is so interesting and really hooks you to watch the movie. The whole time I was watching I was so invested. There’s so many layers to the movie and symbolism that makes you really look at the Philippines in a different lens. This movie really stresses the importance of the legalization of abortion in the Philippines and how sexed should be really promoted among the youth. Apart from that, the side plot of the young child really pulls on ur heartstrings. It’s crazy that some of the things happening in the film is a reality faced by some people. I really like how the movie is an open ending which will really make you reflect and think. I think the child that sunshine is always with is her unborn child. It was kind of hinted when she had blood all over her when sunshine was rushed in the hospital. Also sunshine performing at the end shows that she did get that abortion so she can reach her dream.

monthofmei,10,"I believe in God, I also believe in the sayings of the bible. But, I also believe that a woman should have a freedom to decide for her own body and to pursue her own dreams, rather than to own up a boy's mistake or to follow what the society tells her to do with her own body. Here's the thing, there's been a conflict between Biology & Religion. According to biology a fetus is not considered a human until 16 weeks—which is why abortion is legalized in some countries, but it is only allowed if the embryo is not yet 4 months. Now here's the thing with religious people, it's been said in the commandments that ""murder is a sin"", they believe that fetus are considered human by the time it formed in a woman's body. Which results colliding of each and everyones belief. I believe that they just wanna follow the word of God, but bible is open with variety of interpretations as the books are full of metaphors. It's sad that it came to a point that following a word means controlling womens' body that it came to a point na tinanggalan na nila ng karapatan ang mga kababaihan.

sacriiege,10,"WHAT A FILM!!!! truly one of the best newly released locals i've watched for a while.Manila is a character in this film. within every scene, the city is brought to life in all its flaws and edges; you can hear the passing train in Avenida's motel, the market-market behind Quiapo church, the sellers you pass by in Recto, and the noise of vehicles mixed with the shouts of barkers in Taft as if you were actually there. it was Manila in its rawest sense. amoy na amoy pati polusyon, 'yung ihing natuyo sa kalsada, 'yung usok na buga ng mga pribadong sasakyan—it was the Manila i've come to love and hate at the same time. even upon watching the simple cutscenes of Maris walking along the streets and the hustle and bustle of the city, i realized just how much Manila's gloried failure makes up so much of our identities as Filipinos. the Quiapo scene, however, will be forever etched into my mind. a prayer is a request in hushed tones. see, there will always be a deep-rooted guilt for every Filipino: guilt for knowing what is deemed wrong yet still holding on to it anyway. guilt for the taught sinners. guilt for asking despite being undeserving. guilt for being just feet away from a dark alley filled with frightened women trying to buy black market abortion pills, speaking in small voices to avoid being snitched and arrested. guilt is embedded in the very existence of the people in a country who grew up in God's favor and the Americans' teachings.but fear will always be greater than guilt. and it's what you feel throughout the film from Sunshine, whose greatest fear is letting go of her dream; for Menggay, whose family was the first person who betrayed her; and for all the women who are going through the exact same thing, yet are forced to risk their lives due to underground procedures.what Sunshine portrays is not the twists and turns that are seen within the storyline, nor are there any secrets revealed; rather what it effectively communicates is the complete and utter isolation that young women feel in a society that continually judges them for their decisions and choices, many of which they were forced to make. the weight of cultural expectations, the heavy grip of religious beliefs through the misinterpretation of the Bible, as well as the stigma associated with women who become pregnant, all come together to create an unbearable burden that is carried by the characters in the film. hindi lang 'to tungkol sa babaeng ayaw magkaanak dahil marami pang pangarap. tungkol 'to sa lahat ng babaeng hindi handa, hindi kaya, at ayaw na.",2025-12-08,0,0,watch,True

Mapapa-aral ba ako?exactly. mapapa-aral ba nila? if not, then why bother? a life of a child is indeed precious. but it is only precious if they get to live. honestly, not having access to safe and legalized abortion is a one-way ticket to poverty, high risks of women getting unsafe medications and treatments, and overall normalizing misogyny. this is why the country remains unprogressive. they run back to familiarity and hide behind religion they do not practice at all when confronted with logic and truth. longtermism? no, they perform. they play saint.",2025-12-08,1,0,watch,False

Like yung feeling palang ng buntis ka pero ayaw mo at lahat ng tao pati ang gobyerno ayaw ang aborsiyon dahil ""illegal"" daw. Pero hindi nila nakikita yung mga napapagdaanan nila dahil sa isang pagkakamali. I LOVE how they used a character as an unborn child/conscience grabe yung simbolismo at anlaki ng impact ng character ni Annika. THIS LINE STILL HITS ME ""ang pangarap ko ay kung ano ang pangarap niya"" at yung simplent ""naintindihan kita"" where sunshine felt accepted is so heartwarming. Grabe kuhang kuha talaga nila yung totoong Manila, yung ingay pati na rin yung kalagayan ng lipunan like doon sa hospital scene at yung financial status ni Sunshine. Gustong gusto ko yung ending kasi napapaisip ka kung pina-abort ni Sunshine or hindi. Pero nung na gets ko na parang it hits me the way na naintindihan ko lalo yung meaning nung movie at ano yung gusto niyang iparating sa mga tao. NO DOUBT 5/5 FOR ME kasi it depicts a reality where not all the people realize and understand, lalo na yung mga kabataan na hindi nakakaranas ng teenage pregnancy. Grabe rin yung acting ni Maris dito na bigay niya ng hustisya yung role niya. Very natural lang talaga kasi grabe kitang kita yung emotion ni Sunshine.

Ang konsepto ng 'choice'. Ang karapatang pumili para sa sarili. Minsan--o madalas kung magiging totoo lang naman tayo, iyung ganitong outdated na pag-iisip ay mapapansin mo sa mga regular na pakikipag-usap. Maliit at 'fleeting' remarks, pero nandoon. May bigat.

dan_dalandan23,10,"Naiintindihan mo ba 'ko?Gets ko na. Gets ko na. Sunshine (2024) Directed by Antoinette JadaoneRating: 10 / 10 | MasterpieceMay kakaibang katotohanan ang obrang ito na bihirang makita sa pelikulang Pilipino. Hindi ito nagsusumikap para maging isang maganda o maging patok sa takilya; sa halip, pinipili nitong maging isang mensaheng magulo, maingay, nakakainis, at hindi nakakakomportable sa ordinaryong manonood. Na tulad na lamang ng buhay ng kababaihang araw-araw na nilalamon ng patriyarka at sistemang pampolitika na matagal nang bulok ngunit nananatiling banal sa mata ng nakararami. Habang nanonood ako, hindi ko naramdaman na gusto akong aliwin ng pelikula; ramdam ko na gusto akong iharap sa katotohanang matagal nating tinatakasan. Propaganda ang tingin ng iilang sarado ang isip sa pinaka-mensahe ng pelikulang ito. At doon sila nagkakamali. Isa lamang itong salamin sa kung paanong sistematikong inaalisan ng kapangyarihan ang mga babae, lalo na ang mahihirap.Sa loob ng sistemang ito, ang reproduktibong karapatan ay hindi itinuturing na karapatan, kundi kasalanan. Tahasang pumapanig ito sa kababaihan, hindi dahil sa moralidad, kundi dahil sa realidad: may mga babaeng nabubuntis hindi dahil pinili nila, kundi dahil pinili sila ng karahasang hindi nila hiningi. At sa bansang tulad ng Pilipinas—kung saan ang simbahan ay laging mas malakas kaysa sa pagkakaroon ng sentido kumon—ang buntis na biktima ay mas madaling husgahan kaysa sa irresponsableng partner o manggagahasang ama o kapamilya. Sa pelikula, hindi ginawang melodrama ang talakayan ng rape at incest; hindi ito ipinakita para lang sa shock value. Bagkus, ipinakita itong ordinaryong trauma, tila bahagi ng tahimik na kultura ng pamilyang mas pinahahalagahan ang so-called ""delikadeza” kaysa sa hustisya. Mas pinahahalagahan ang pangalan kaysa kaligtasan. Hindi exaggerated ang ganitong representasyon; nakakatakot dahil alam nating totoo.Naging sentro rin sa pelikula ang kabiguan ng sistemang pangkalusugan. Hindi lamang ito inefficient; ito ay moralistic, judgmental, at nakaprograma para parusahan ang mahihirap at mahihina. Ang ospital dito ay hindi naging tahanan ng lunas, kundi naging lungga ng "" pagiging moral"" na kung saan ang mahihirap ay hindi tinutulungan, kundi hinuhusagan. Sino ang karapat-dapat mabuhay? Sino ang dapat magdusa para masabing matuto? Bilang manonood at kahit isang mg lalake sa bansang ito, nakakagigil ang katotohanang ang pagpunta sa ospital ay hindi palaging pagsalba sa sarili kundi pagpasok sa isang tribunal kung saan ikaw, na biktima, ang dapat magpaliwanag.At dito ko mas naranasan ang kakapalan ng pelikula sa pagrepresenta sa Maynila. Hindi ito glamorized poverty porn; hindi rin romanticized chaos. Ito ang Maynilang nakakapagod kahit tumingin ka lang: ingay ng mga lasinggero sa tabi, tunog ng tren na daraan sa tapat ng bahay mo, sermon ng mga matatanda na “mabait ang Diyos, anak, humingi ka ng kapatawaean.” Ito ang lungsod kung saan ang relihiyon ay sobrang pinapalandakan sa bawat isa, kung saan ang pagiging babae ay isang pampublikong dominyo, at kung saan ang morality policing ay kasing regular ng traffic dito. Para sa marami, nakaka-stress panoorin; para sa iba, nakaka-Filipino. Sa akin, nakaka-trigger dahil ito ang araw-araw na karahasan na hindi natin laging tinatawag na karahasan. Nakakasakit na sa mismong kapwa babae pa nanggagaling ang mga karahasan nito laban sa kanila. Sa gitna ng lahat ng ito, si Maris Racal ang pinakanagbuhat ng pelikula. Totoo, marami na siyang napatunayan bilang artista, pero dito naging malinaw na hindi lang siya artista. Mas higit pa siya roon. Hindi niya ginawang martir o heroine ang karakter niya; inangkin niya ang pagiging imperfect, resentful, selfish kung kinakailangan ng kaniyang Sunshine. At sa kulturang pinapaboran ang babaeng martir na tahimik na lumulunok ng sakit, ang pagganap niya ay isang uri ng pag-aalsa. Hindi siya nagtatangkang humingi ng awa, pinapakita niya na kahit sobrang sakit na, sobrang nakakapagod na, kaya ito. Kaya niya. Kakayanin niya laban sa mga putanginang lalaking nagpapahirap, hindi lang sa kaniya, kundi pati sa kaniyang kapuwa. Kung may direktor na may kakayahang magbitiw ng ganitong pahayag, si Antoinette Jadaone lang iyon. Ang direksyon niya ay hindi preachy, hindi sentimental, hindi deperado para maging tawagin ng ilan na isang woke film. May talim ang mga metapora niya, pero lubog na lubog sa reyalidad. Ito ay pang-araw-araw na simbolismo ng mga babaeng kailangang lumaban ang sarili para mabuhay. Katulad ng mga tauhan ni Jennica Garcia, Annika Co, Xyriel Manabat, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, at Angeli Bayani.Walang mali sa pelikula. Ito ang reyalidad. Sa kung sino ang maaapektuhan at tututol, isa na kayo sa problema. Hindi babae ang problema. Ang problema ay lipunang gumagamit at dumidikta sa kanila.• Resonance / Impact: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ • Cinematography / Visuals: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★• Acting / Performance: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★• Direction: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★• Soundtrack / Score: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★• Plot / Storytelling: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Final Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★",2025-12-07,0,0,watch,True

k0ela_,10,"Sunshine is a film that sheds light on the harsh realities many women face—realities that are often overlooked or silenced. It’s an eye-opening story that refuses to sugarcoat the truth; instead, it boldly exposes how flawed our system can be. I firmly stand with Sunshine—respectfully, no one, no law, and no religion should ever dictate what a woman chooses to do with her own body.One of the most powerful moments is the ending, with her unborn child’s quiet assurance, “Gets ko na.” That single line hits deeply. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the smallest gestures carry the heaviest weight. I’m grateful the film allowed Sunshine to choose herself.Overall, this movie touched every bit of my soul—I had goosebumps the entire time. Sunshine isn’t just a film; it’s an experience you feel in your chest, something too deep to put into words.Shine, gets na gets kita. 🥺",2025-12-07,0,0,watch,False

augustisaugust,10,"Hindi ako magaling sa pag kritiko ng mga bagay-bagay, lalo na sa mga pelikula. Pero sinusubukan ko. Ang pelikulang ""Sunshine"" idinirekta ni Antoinette Jadaone sobrang danas at isyu sa bansang Pilipinas. Ang ganda ng set sa manila, ang raw, rinig at ramdam mo ang init, sikip, usok, baho, at gulo. Noong tatapatin pa lang niya yung nakabuntis sa kanya itong salita agad ang pumasok sa isip kong sasabihin ng lalaki e,""Sigurado ka bang sa akin 'yan?"" Ito talaga ang una mong maririnig sa isang lalaki kapag sinabi ng isang babae na ""buntis ako"". Walang hiyang linya 'yan imbes na pagsuporta kay Sunshine pagdududa ang ibibigay para ikaila yung responsibilidad, lalaki nga. hahahahaha, sorry kung may pagka discriminate sa parteng ito pero iyan ang reyalidad. Sunod naman yung batang si Anika, noong una hindi ko gets bakit bigla siyang susulpot at mawawala. Para sa akin para siyang inner child ni Sunshine kung susuriin yung pelikula sa bandang dulo nang tinuloy ni Sunshine na gamitin yung nabiling gamot sa Ale sa quiapo, basta fast-forward sa tricycle, makikita na yung legs ni Anika ay may dugo rin which is sign na ganon ang epekto ng nabili niyang gamot o pag abort, hindi ko ma explain pero gets na yan, at kung paano huminga si Sunshine ganoon din siya noong isinusugod na siya sa hospital. Tapos parang noong una hindi pa gets ni Anika yung mga desisyon ni Sunshine sa kagustuhang magpa abort pero yung sa huli nakita niya kung paano mahal at gusto ni Sunshine yung pangrap niya kaya I love the part na sinabi niya na ""gets ko na"" ika niya nga. Tapos if you think yung pagintindi ay hindi nanggaling sa iba kundi sa sarili niya diba????? So, ito na nga dahil binanggit ko na ang quiapo, gusto ko rin yung scene na matapos niyang malaman na buntis siya dumiretso agad siya sa simbahan para mag dasal. why? kasi may guilt siya part niya sana gets niyo ako, staka super religious o predominant catholic itong bansa natin, sana gets hahahaha...tapos diba yung binilhan ni Sunshine ng pangpa abort parang katabi o malapit sa simbahan parang na pinipilit ng relihiyon at batas ang mga babae sa isang krisis, ngunit ang parehong lugar din ang kanilang takbuhan para maghanap ng bawal na solusyon. Sobrang konserbatibong bansa. At sunod ulit yung pag bili niya ng illegal na pangpa abort, no choice e, walang health care sa mga katulad niyang may ganoong problem. diba? ang lala ng sistema, walang program na pwedeng lapitan right away. Kasi ano ang unang nangyayari o ginagawa ng mga tao pag ang isang babae ay buntis, ang gagawin ng ibang tao manghusga ngunit hindi naman handang magbigay ng practical na tulong. Kaya ang katuwang lang ng babae ay sino? Sarili, dignidad, at pangrap. Kaya, gets ko si Sunshine sa mga desisyon niya, it's a relief for her kung gagawin niya yung illegal. At huli, sobrang galing ni Maris Racal, hanga ako, dalang-dala niya talaga yung bigat ng karakter. Mata-mata acting at yung pag perform niya galing. Huli na talaga, gustong-gusto ko ang mura ng batang si Anika, galing! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",2025-12-07,0,0,watch,True

And those people have to make decisions that sometimes are not acceptable to norms or beliefs. But Maris Racal delivers a story of a girl na hindi humihingi ng sympathy kundi karapatan. Karapatan na mamili. Karapatan na magpatuloy. Karapatan na mangarap. For me, it's not just a simple talk tungkol sa abortion; it’s about access, fairness, and acknowledging na hindi tayo pare-pareho ng laban.We don’t have to personally want what Sunshine wants. Pero we must understand why she has to fight for it. Kung bakit may mga oportunidad na dapat bukas para sa lahat kahit na hindi natin ito kailangan.

Ang ironic lang for me na kalat sa labas ng Quiapo ang bentahan ng mga gamot pampalaglag, habang ang sistema natin ay patuloy na tutol sa ganitong paraan. Goosebumps when my friends and I noticed the sign sa jeep saying “Gift of God”, we came up with only one assumption of what that sign is trying to tell the viewers. Simply, babies are a blessing. And that’s what they’ll always say whenever abortion comes up in a conversation.The symbolism of the Kid who has been following Sunshine all throughout the film. My first assumption was— she was the conscience of the latter. Obviously, lumalabas siya every time na may gagawin si Sunshine sa pagbubuntis niya. Siya ang constant reminder na lahat nang gagawin niya ay mali. Second, it was Sunshine’s younger version. Trying to tell her something. Pero bandang dulo ng film it was revealed na it was the baby. I would like to believe na malaki ang naging parte niya sa naging desisyon ni Sunshine. Because Sunshine was the happiest when she’s doing what she love. Walang karapatan ang kahit sino man sa magiging desisyon ng babae para sa katawan niya.Super dami kong pang gustong sabihin sa film na ‘to kasi super pleased ako sa mga details and symbolisms.

Hindi ko naiintindihan, are the words na lagi kong sagot kada ang response niya sakin ay “kasi ikaw ang buhay ko”, kasi ang kapalit nun sakin ay yung mga responsibilidad na maging mas matalino, mas magaling, na hindi option ang pumalpak, especially when it comes to decisions.Sabi ko, hindi ko naiintindihan kasi sayang. Lahat ng kung ano ako ngayon, lahat ng mga narating ko ngayon, dapat siya na yun, o mas higit pa kung nilakasan niya lang loob niya. Ika nga, in this world we can’t always get all that we want, kaya sa kabila ng bawa’t hindi ko maintindihan, siya ring may katapat na naiintindihan ko. Gets ko na, hindi pala na sayang, dahil siya din naman ang lahat ng kung ano ako ngayon, dahil dun palang sa pinili niya ako para maging anak niya, kahit pa na may kapalit iyong mga responsibilidad hindi lang para sakin kundi para din sa kaniya, dun palang sa araw na yun, isang matapang na pagpasya din ang ginawa niya para piliin na kaming dalawa ang magkakampi sa bawat laban na haharapin namin. Gets ko na, na hindi lang sakin to mahirap, na masyado ring mahirap itong mundong ito para sa kaniya, kaya’t ano pa’t para dumagdag pa ako sa mga kalaban niya.I feel like most daughters shares this same sentiments and dreams for their mothers of wanting them to choose themselves even if it means not having the chance to be born in this world, and that’s what makes me love this movie. It comforted me to have the perception of making that dream come true for my own mom. It showed the depth of the understanding between the mother and their child especially their daughters. Just when we thought it’s already deep, it could get more deeper.Gets ko na.

As a man na lumaki sa very conservative and religious na family, I’ve always been socially aware. I am pro abortion but I never really know kung gaano kalalim yung pinaglalaban natin, well atleast not until I saw this film.Bilang lalaki na manonood, I can only empathize & be compassionate towards sunshine because I feel like nobody can understand her better than women themselves. Highlight ng film for me is yung scene ni Maris sa motel, besides feeling a sense of dread, it also fills me with anger dahil babae pa din talaga ang sasalo sa lahat ng hirap. Anong ginawa ng nakabuntis? binigyan lang ng pera si sunshine, that’s it. Si sunshine yung naghirap, nasaktan, at napahiya. Kaya ang galing ng pelikula kasi nakuha niya gaano pa rin ka pabor ang mundo sa mga kalalakihan.Ang ganda ng casting, sobrang buhay nila na pwede ko lang silang makita sa labas ng bahay namin.

arthouzhi,10,"Sunshine (2024) looks soft, warm, almost gentle on the surface. the colors cradle you, the scenes feel tender, and at first, you think it is comforting. but beneath all of that warmth carries a weight that is impossible to ignore. it is about abortion in the Philippines, where it is illegal, and labeled as “blasphemous,” “disgraceful,” and judged above the lives it affects. the film does not shy away from showing how cruel reality can be. people, even doctors, prioritize morality over humanity, ignoring the pain, the fear, and the uncertainty of the woman at the center. it shows a woman whose future and potential clash with society’s judgment.the unknown girl who follows Sunshine feels like a younger version of herself. she is the part of Sunshine that believes abortion is wrong, the part that cannot yet grasp the weight of a life lived on someone else’s terms. and yet, by the end, she mutters, “gets ko na.” she sees that Sunshine’s life is not a simple question of right and wrong. she feels the burden Sunshine carries, the life she cannot give without losing herself. she recognizes how much was left for Sunshine to live, how much potential to burn bright, and how pregnancy would have dimmed it. she senses the life that should have belonged to Sunshine alone.the realization does not absolve, it recognizes the choices forced upon someone who should have been free to live her life on her own terms. that recognition shatters you more than any argument, any moral lesson ever could.watching this film, you feel everything at once. the warmth of the colors, the softness of the scenes, the love in small gestures, and then the ache, the rage, the grief that lingers because the world can be cruel, unfair, unfeeling. Sunshine is about life that is too heavy for the judgment of others. it is about the potential snuffed out when morality is chosen over empathy. it is about understanding, even when the world cannot. it is gentle, devastating, and necessary. it will stay with you long after the credits roll.Sunshine is soft to watch, hard to forget, and brutally honest about the ways society fails those who need understanding the most.it will make you feel what it is to live, to choose, to survive, and to understand when understanding is all that remains.",2025-12-05,0,0,watch,True

Kawawa parehas diba? The kid's unloved, tapos reminder pa ng pang aabuso sa nanay niya. Anti-divorce law can't make a broken family happy again. It not just damage the parents, but also the kids. ""Kids might suffer from broken families"" daw kasiAh, so, ipipilit mo? So mas okay na nakikita ng mga anak nila na nagsisigawan sila, na nag sasakitan at ginagawang punching bag yung nanay nila kaysa maghiwalay?!Keeping these bans doesn’t uphold morality, it endangers women, silences survivors, and empowers abusers.You're not protecting anyone but the perpetrators.And I hope this film serves as a message.",2025-12-04,2,0,watch,False

aijikken,10,"Sunshine is one of those rare Filipino films that refuses to look away. Instead of sugarcoating or romanticizing the world its characters inhabit, it confronts the audience with the uncomfortable truths we collectively sidestep—the toxic mindsets we inherit, the social issues we normalize, and the moral rigidity we mistake for virtue.What makes the film remarkable is its honesty. It acknowledges how deeply ingrained complacency is in our culture, how we often witness injustice, misogyny, or dysfunction and simply shrug, labeling it as “ganun talaga.” Sunshine exposes that mentality for what it is: a quiet violence that enables suffering. The film does not preach; it simply presents the weight of these realities with clarity and emotional intelligence, letting the audience feel the consequences of silence and inaction.Its commentary on anti-abortion attitudes is especially bold for Philippine cinema. Rather than reducing the debate to dogma or melodrama, the film shows how anti-abortion rhetoric becomes a peril for women; not just physically, but emotionally, socially, and economically. It reveals how denying reproductive autonomy restricts their futures, limits their ambitions, and punishes them for choices men are rarely held accountable for. Sunshine portrays this with nuance: the internal conflict, the fear of judgment, the systemic lack of support, and the complete absence of safe options. The film understands that this isn’t just a “moral issue”—it’s a structural one, tied to poverty, misogyny, and societal expectations about what women owe to the world.Ultimately, Sunshine is more than a movie; it’s a critique of the culture that raised us. It forces us to ask why we maintain harmful traditions, why morality is weaponized against women, and why we accept inequality as a norm. Its power lies in its refusal to let the audience remain comfortable, and in reminding us that the first step toward progress is learning to confront what we’ve been taught to ignore.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False
sxdyey,10,"Films like this make me realize how great the potential of the PH film industry is when it comes to storytelling, creativity, and taking risks. Sunshine proves exactly that. Ang tapang ng pelikulang ‘to, not just in the execution, but sa choice of subject matter. Makamasa, madaling kapitan, and at the same time, a real eye-opener. From start to finish, ramdam mo yung puso at bigat ng kuwento, and yet ang linis ng pagkakadala.Maris Racal shines in a way that’s both raw and controlled; she gives a performance that stays with you long after the credits roll. Jennica Garcia is equally powerful, grabe yung presence niya, every scene hits (we all need a family member like her!!). Together, they carry the emotional core of the film so well na hindi mo mapigilang maapektuhan like ALL I CAN SAY IS I REALLY LOVE WOMEN SM.But above all, very important yung conversation na binubuksan ng Sunshine. Abortion is a difficult, nuanced topic—one that should be openly discussed not just within families, but within our society and government. And I firmly believe na choosing yourself first, your success, your safety, your future matters just as much. AND, women should be able to decide for themselves: their body, their rules. This isn't a simple issue, and the film treats it with the depth and humanity it deserves.Sunshine is indeed a courageous and a necessary film that everyone should watch!!",2025-12-04,1,0,watch,True

slimedeni,10,"this is what the filipino people need to see more often. it might be obscure for some, but it is timely and important. teenage mothers are often judged for carrying a child; whether they keep it or not, judgement will still eye on them. the guilt of their conscience will still haunt and hunt them. but we never get to see their point of view, we only see them for the mistakes they have done. where is that energy when it comes to boys who choose to abandon the outcome of their bad decisions? nowhere. i love how this film doesn’t just show us the story of a teenage girl who got pregnant while chasing her dreams—it is a story of all the girls and women who are forced to carry a baggage they never asked for. we saw their hardships and struggles. it also shows us how flawed our system is and how hypocritical some religious people are. this should be a wake up call. the little girl (annika) doesn’t just represent sunshine’s unborn child—she also represents us. we only see abortion and choosing oneself as something wrong and sinful because we are too blinded by what was merely taught to us. we never get to see or feel what others feel. and once we do, we will understand them. that is when we will realize. let’s be more like the little girl, let’s try to understand more.i also love that they chose manila as the setting of this film. it might not be important but i think it is. manila is messy, scary, and it will kill you. but once you overcome it, you’ll see its beauty.lastly, sorry pero super bothered talaga ko sa part na nasa lope de vega na sila tapos ang layo pa ng hospital na pinuntahan nila e mas malapit naman ang metro, san lazaro, or jose reyes. 😞🙏🏼 bothered lang ako pero gets ko naman kung bakit, so wala na lang yon, di siya mahalaga. hahaha",2025-12-03,1,0,watch,True

sircylovesyou,10,"Women in the Philippines continue to grapple with deeply rooted issues such as teenage pregnancy which is made even more complex by the country’s predominantly Catholic identity. The moral codes and expectations instilled in us from childhood often determine whether society views abortion as a sinful act or a necessary choice, and this cultural tension becomes the silent force shaping many young women’s lives.In the film, Maris Racal embodies this struggle with striking emotional clarity. She carries the weight of a decision that no young woman should have to make alone: the impossible choice between holding on to her dream of becoming an Olympian or confronting the life-altering reality of an unexpected pregnancy. Her performance is powerful not because it dramatizes the dilemma, but because it mirrors the experiences of countless Filipinas whose voices are often dismissed or shamed into silence.What elevates the film is how it frames her situation not as a moral failure, but as a human story: one shaped by fear, hope, societal pressure, and the search for agency. Through Racal’s nuanced portrayal, the narrative exposes the cultural contradictions we live with: a society that celebrates the achievements of young women yet imposes rigid expectations on their bodies and choices. The film invites the audience to move beyond judgment and recognize the quiet courage required to stand at the crossroads of identity, aspiration, and responsibility.In grounding a personal crisis within the broader context of Philippine social norms, the film becomes more than a character study; it becomes a commentary on how we, as a society, often fail to extend empathy to young women navigating impossible circumstances. And in that sense, Maris does not just act the role; she embodies a truth many are too uncomfortable to confront.",2025-12-03,1,0,watch,True

The moment the truth sinks in — that this girl, brimming with hope and ambition, is now carrying a life she never asked for — the world she built starts cracking. Maris Racal gives a performance that doesn’t feel like acting — even when she’s silent, you feel every tremor of fear, every doubt, every moment she prays for a different ending. The film doesn’t paint shades of grey — it throws you into a world where choices are dangerous, and every door seems closed.And the way the city closes in around her — tight alleys, cold clinics, judgmental stares, desperation disguised as quiet — Sunshine doesn’t just tell a story. It burrows underneath your skin and refuses to leave.

jazzphen,10,"Finally had a chance to watch this, i was meant to watch this when it was showing at the cinemas but so busy until recently saw news that it was gonna come out on Netflix so i was elated. Haha.I like it so much, i love the cast in this film, and i love seeing this kind of quality in Filipino movies which is super rare these days. The story is about a young woman who has a dream that she pursued her whole life and suddenly she becomes pregnant which risks this dream, and now she has to weigh everything carefully because either which choice she pick will be life-changing. The whole movie revolves around that and we get to be introduced to the characters and the environment around her that is essential and will influence the choice she will make. Here we get to see a real picture even though the story is fictional, as filipinos you could almost grasp the realness out of this film and say, this is the REALITY but we don't have to embrace it, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT. As a man, I always believed that i am no position to speak about what women should and shouldn't do about their bodies, but will absolutely support the concept of abortion. When we speak about abortion in a country that is like the Philippines, that is so centered on religion, abortion becomes a taboo, illegal and unethical. We also see these professionals, government leaders that support this kind of ideology that abortion is bad blah blah blah. This film is a great commentary and an eye opener to what young women and women in general what they go through, and that abortion should become an option for all women in our society. I will just make it clear that i think this film is not pro abortion or anti life, without directly stating it, the film focuses on making better decisions, the importance of protection, sex is more common than we think which is ironic in the Philippines that is so religious but that’s ok, this country just needs proper education and thats it. PS. If you are going to argue with me about me being ok about abortion or use of protection, I’m going to tell you this, how dare you bring a life in this world, in this country that cant do anything about poverty, cant do anything about corrupt politicians, cant vote right, doesn't have an accessible healthcare and on top of that, if you’re a man, stfu, and if you’re a woman, who is not ready, physically, mentally and financially, Ari and that young girl doesn’t deserve to live like that, on the streets or getting abused. But if you are, financially stable, mentally stable and physically stable with a nice and healthy environment to grow a living thing then go fucking crazy.",2025-12-03,0,0,watch,False

flreu,10,"Ang hirap maging babaeng puno ng pangarap. The film Sunshine (2024) resonated with me because it honestly depicts how unforgiving reality can be. It shows how quickly people judge young women, often before they even have a chance to breathe or ask for help. The film also makes painfully clear how the lack of reproductive rights pushes women toward risky, sometimes dangerous choices. You can almost feel Sunshine being boxed in on all sides, not because she did anything wrong, but because society refuses to give her real options.Women in the Philippines face judgment, limited choices, and immense pressure around pregnancy. And the film makes a point I strongly agree with: no government or religious institution should dictate what a woman does with her body. Those decisions belong to the person living that reality, not to people watching from a distance.Sunshine made the right choice. Sobrang taboo sa Pilipinas ang usapang abortion, pero at least the child didn’t grow up feeling guilty or resenting their mother for what might have happened if they hadn’t been born. It’s better for a child to know they were truly wanted, rather than feeling like the product of someone else’s dilemma. Constantly being told they’re a blessing can’t replace the sense of being genuinely chosen.Sana ma-gets ng lahat si Sunshine.",2025-12-03,4,0,watch,True

mswholovesfilm,10,"SOBRA SOBRANG GANDA NG PELIKULA NI DIREK TONETsa sobrang ganda i had to watched it 2 times. hindi ko alam ma fefeel ko after kong unang panuodin ito, sobrang lungkot at bigat dahil alam kong hindi lang ito basta pelikula kundi realidad ng bawat babae, bawat tao, at bawat batang muntik makita ang mundo.i love the jeepney scene, It was a really heavy scene, I think it was me interpreting na iniisip na ni sunshine na 'bakit??, bakit saakin pa? baka hindi na ako makasama sa olympics na ito- bakit?' maybe there was this question of confusion na kahit siya hindi niya masagot.. na kahit saan siya dalhin ni kuya manong at ibaba dala dala parin niya talaga ito (yung bata)I loved how this film not only focuses on abortion rights, but also shows many of the real problems in the Philippines.Napakita talaga kung gaano ka–fucked up ang sistema ng mga hospital dito—kulang sa pasilidad, nagsisiksikan, at ang daming pwedeng mamatay dahil sa ganitong sistema. Sobrang nakakagalit isipin na sa hospital ka pa dapat may chance mabuhay, pero doon ka pa pwedeng bawian.It also shows the messed-up beliefs of people who think it’s “easy” to raise a child. Yung mga nagsasabing “takot mo sa una lang ‘yan” at “biyaya ‘yan ng Panginoon.” I’m not against their beliefs—they’re entitled to them—but I find it toxic. Paano mo kayang sabihin sa isang tao na “biyaya” ito kung galing sa karumaldumal at walang kamalay-malay na kasalanan ng ibang tao? Paano mo sasabihing tanggapin niya na lang ito?I think not everything can be called a blessing. And I don’t think it’s fair to say “binigay ito ng Diyos” kahit mali ang pinanggalingan. When I watched it for the second time, ang dami ko talagang na-notice. Naging malaking tanong sa’kin kung *paano* at *saan* narealize ni Sunshine ang lahat.At first, akala ko si Annika (yung batang babae) was her inner child someone who guides her, the version of herself who dreamed of becoming an Olympian but never got the chance.Yung part sa ilalim ng tulay, nung lumabas na si Ariana — doon ko talaga na-connect. I think Sunshine realized it too. Habang hinahanap niya si Sunshine, hindi siya mapakali. Naging question ko rin talaga kung paano kilala ni Sunshine si Ariana if kakakita niya lang dito? Diba??!And what Ariana said made sense. May part sa movie na sinabi niya na ayaw niyang bumalik sa bahay dahil wala namang may pakialam sa kanya. sabi ni Sunshine doon “Hindi, naguguluhan lang siya.” i think she was referring to marygrace.The conversation between Ariana and Annika (the little girl) really altered my brain.The way they pictured the life they could’ve had in a world they will never get to be part of sobrang bigat..And that line, “Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap ni Sunshine,” grabe.sobrang naiyak ako sa part ng ate niya at si sunshine, grave sobrang galing talaga ni direk tonet. tinanggap at inintindi niya ito ng buong buo mabuhay talaga ang pelikulang ito.Lastly! finally!(ang sobrang daming yap)the last part, yung “gets ko na.” Those words explained everything.It felt like Sunshine was saying,“I hope naiintindihan mo kung bakit ko ‘to ginagawa.”And i know that’s exactly how she felt.Maybe the girl can’t have the world.But no—actually, she did.Because she gave Sunshine the world she always wanted, even if she couldn’t have it herself. ""Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap niya""That “gets ko na” part really hit me.Sobrang bigat. And right after that line,there was a cut showing Sunshine in this moment of relief and it says so much kahit na walang description kahit walang explanation.i love this film na gustong kong yakapin si sunshine at hawakan ang kamay niya at sabihing ""hindi mo ito kasalanan""",2025-12-03,0,0,watch,True

It's truly time to wake up and see why abortion is needed especially with teen pregnancies kasi minsan lalaki talaga ang problema, kahit ano sabihin mo, hindi sila kikinig and now women are left with this burden and guilt. The addition of catholic guilt is so UGH AMAZING! Especially with religion being used as a reason to make abortion illegal because it's God's gift. There's so much I want to say about this film but talaga, one of the best films I have watched!!

rdileys,10,"i have a lot to say about this movie but if i were to describe it in one sentence, it would be: ang hirap maging babae, at mas mahirap maging babae sa pilipinas. i can tell that this story is well-written. it is my first time watching a filipino movie so realistic and women-focused. this movie depicted the struggles of being a woman—not just sexually, but in all aspects. women are expected to be perfect—capable of carrying the weight, not expected to make any mistakes despite everything hateful is being thrown at us. we are expected to meet and be the standard even if it is out of our capabilities. dahil? babae tayo. at kung ‘di man natin maabot ‘yon, isa tayong kahihiyan. dahil nga, mga babae tayo. kalaban natin ang relihiyon, gobyerno, at bansa na mapang-husga. ika nga ni coach, drown out the noise. but that is not the case. even if you force yourself to be apathetic, you’ll still hear the the voices of the people. mga kabataan nga naman ngayon, hindi na makapag-pigilbawal ‘yan sa batas ng Diyoshindi ko ma-a-admit kaibigan mo dahil illegal ‘yonkung buntis ka, i’ll have to kick you out of my rosteranother thing i loved about this movie is that it was shot in manila and covereed many social issues—making it even more relatable to us filipino. especially when it comes to poverty, dito talaga natin masasabi na mahirap maging mahirap. the film showed the reality of life for those without privilege—struggling to find a tricycle, not having enough money for basic needs, and doing everything we can just to earn a little. even parents are driven to the point of selling their own children.some men, on the other hand, can run away from everything. nakabuntis? kasalanan pa rin natin ‘yang mga babae! kesyo hindi tayo nananamit nang maayos, kesyo tayo raw ang may mali kahit sila naman ang tumakbo sa responsibilidad. here, i saw how cowardly some men can be—afraid to take responsibility for their wrongdoings, and always ready to cling to anyone who will shield them from consequences.lastly, i love how the kids represented their inner child—sunshine’s bata symbolizing her dream of becoming an olympian, while menggay’s bata represented the lgbtq community and her longing to get revenge on those who wronged her. each represented their dreams, no matter how impossible they seemed in their circumstances. each represented their dreams, clinging to whatever little piece of themselves the world hasn’t taken away.",2025-12-02,0,0,watch,True

solanaa,10,"I don't remember where I first heard of it, but the idea has always stayed with me: for every abortion, miscarriage, or infertility, if a women desires to be a mother, it will come to her at the right time—in one form or another.And I think this film beautifully echoes hints of that belief.The part where Sunshine asks the little girl, ""Naiintindihan mo na ba ako?"" And the child replies, ""Gets ko na,"" feels like a simple, but so profound of an exchange of words. It feels like a hand that's gently soothing a wound she's been carrying all this time. A wound that asked to be seen with the nuances that came with it, not the fantasies the society chooses to blind themselves with.Another thing that stood out to me abt this film is how it challenges the viewers to confront the expectations forced onto women simply for existing. Not with judgement, but with a silence that understands what it means to be human.I just love that this film respects women's choices. It doesn't force a message or a narrative that motherhood is the only path to walk through once it enters in a woman's life. Instead, it says that your life, dreams, and timing are all yours regardless of what everyone thinks nor says abt it.Because to be a mother means to be ready mentally, physically, and financially. Love alone isn't enough to carry a life, just a majority of its suffering.",2025-12-02,0,0,watch,True

mus3ira,10,"ive been waiting for this to come out on netflix and it is honestly such a GREAT commentary on anti-abortion laws in the philippines and in religious/third world countries as a whole. it truly is a privilege to have the right to our own bodies.the writing of this movie was quite interesting and i believe the children held so much significance to the development and the decision making of the main lead. i believe they are the make-believe consciousness of the “thing” (lets stop calling them babies PLEASE) inside the main lead and the 13yo girl, and i LOVED being so confused and then realising this later on. “drown out the noise” something we need to tell ourselves more often than not. we shouldn’t listen to outside opinions of what to do with ourselves and our own bodies. it is the happiest way to live and love life.i hold this movie very close to my heart and living in a country where abortion is legal is a HUGE privilege and i look forward to the days where religious doctrine dont run the government and put its citizens in a chokehold. religious or not, DON’T tell ANYONE what to do with their bodies, we are all in different circumstances and have wants/dreams/aspirations we’d like to pursue for our own happiness and that’s not selfish.",2025-12-02,0,0,watch,False

titingtumulak,10,"Society claims to protect the “unborn child,” yet the conversation often leaves out the women whose bodies, health, and futures are directly involved. It feels unsettling to watch how easily society dismisses the experiences of women, as if their lives become secondary the moment they become pregnant. I can’t ignore how deeply this connects to the patriarchal norms I’ve grown up seeing. From subtle expectations to outright judgment, there is a long history of controlling women’s bodies and decisions. The shame placed on those who consider or seek abortion is not just personal; it is cultural and religious, embedded in systems that teach us to shame and question women’s choices instead of supporting them. This made us more aware of how easily society turns compassion into condemnation when it comes to reproductive health.P'wede ba pag walang matres, 'wag na bumoses?",2025-12-02,0,0,watch,False

feldelrey,10,"What stayed with me long after the credits rolled is how Sunshine understands the quiet corners of being young. The ones filled with fear you don’t even have language for yet, and the hope you still hold anyway. The film doesn’t chase shock value; instead, it trusts stillness, letting the soft ache of its characters speak for themselves.And then there’s that storyline about the 13-year-old girl, pregnant because of her own uncle. OH GOD. That shattered me. It’s horrifying, devastating, and the film doesn’t sanitize the truth of it. It shows how violence like that hides inside families, how children are left carrying consequences for sins that were never theirs. I felt so much grief and anger for that kid; it’s the kind of scene that makes you sit there and go quiet because it hurts in a very real way. The film’s exploration of choice, shame, and the pressure to “grow up correctly” hits even harder because of moments like that. It never lectures. It simply shows how heavy it is to carry circumstances shaped by adults who should’ve protected you. Maris Racal delivers an immaculate kind of devastation in this role. There’s a sharpness to every look she gives, a trembling truth in every word, that feels painfully real. She breaks open the character’s longing, lets the fear spill out raw, and turns her strength into something that rises slowly from the wreckage. It’s a performance that destroys you and stays spotless in its honesty.Sunshine is the kind of film that lingers. Soft, bruising, furious when it needs to be, and quietly bright in all the places that matter.",2025-12-01,4,0,watch,True

intjyhnn,10,"Ang pelikulang Sunshine ay hindi lang simpleng kwento ng isang babae—isa itong salamin sa maraming isyung matagal nang umiikot sa Pilipinas pero pilit pa ring isinasantabi. Nagawa ng pelikula ito na ilahad ang mga sakit ng sistemang kinabibilangan natin: mula sa pakikibaka ng kababaihan sa kanilang sariling katawan hanggang sa nakakalungkot na estado ng ating healthcare system.Isa sa pinakamalinaw na ipinupukol ng pelikula ay ang isyu ng aborsyon. Ipinapakita ng pelikula kung gaano kahirap ang desisyong hinaharap ng mga kababaihan—lalo na sa bansang halos bawal pag-usapan ang reproductive rights. Nakakahalit dahil hanggang ngayon, marami pa ring kababaihan ang hindi ganap na malaya sa sarili nilang katawan dahil sa malalim na kapit ng konserbatismong relihiyoso. Sa halip na suportahan, hinuhusgahan sila. Sa halip na pakinggan, pinapatahimik. At gaya ng ipinapakita sa pelikula, napipilitang harapin ng mga babae ang mga sitwasyong hindi nila pinili, wala man lang ligtas o legal na option para makaligtas..Kasunod nito, mariing binabangga ng pelikula ang realidad ng ating healthcare system. Hindi na bago ang nakikitang eksena sa ospital: siksikan, kulang sa gamit, at kapos sa espasyo. Dalawa, minsan tatlong ina sa iisang kama—hindi dahil gusto nila, kundi dahil wala talagang mapaglagyan. Ito ang reyalidad na hinaharap ng ordinaryong Pilipino araw-araw, habang ang mga pulitikong may kapangyarihan ay kayang lumipad paabroad para magpagamot sa mas kumpletong pasilidad.Sa kabuuan, nagsilbing boses ang Sunshine para sa mga isyung matagal nang dinidinig ngunit hindi pinakikinggan.

And of course, this also shows the effects of our flawed healthcare system, it's inaccessible and expensive, pushing women to resort to those kinds of practices.

But the important thing is what you choose to do when you’re going through something difficult and nobody is there to help you. Even when you feel alone, useless, or hopeless, don’t give up. You can still reach what you want and chase your dreams. Just keep going and keep fighting.As a man, I feel sorry for Sunshine, but believe me, there are many good men in this world better than selfish and stupid men and I learned from this movie how to be a better man. Use protection when you’re doing something intimate, and if you don’t, make sure you can take responsibility for your actions. Live wisely and don’t make rushed decisions. Every choice you make shapes your future. We may not regret our actions in the moment, but we regret them later.And for other men, I want to say this if you have a girlfriend, make sure she’s happy with you.

cyluvspicy,10,"worth watching fr! i love all the subtle scenes — like sa jeep na may “gift of god” sa harap, the super makadiyos billboards, every convo with annika and her gay friend (ariana), and yung scenes na kahit nasa crowd siya, you still notice her. alam mo yun, kahit sobrang simple at halos walang make-up, she still shines. And the cinematography is a solid 10 out of 10.this movie shows how cruel the system is for women in general. with a patriarchal society and a conservative country, talagang “jackpot” maging babae. it also highlights how badly we need proper sex education and why decriminalizing abortion should be pushed hard!gigil ako dun sa hayop na bobot, yung unang doctora na super pabida, at siyempre special mention kay miggy at sa pastor niyang tatay.overall, this movie hit me in a way na kahit hindi ako in sunshine’s situation, ramdam ko pa rin. as a woman, it just made me realize again how much we deal with. it’s not just a good movie it’s the type na kahit okay ka naman, pero pag may sad song, bigla kang nagrereflect. that’s exactly the energy it gave me. kudos to the director, and of course maris, who always gives justice to every character.",2025-12-01,1,0,watch,False

projectcedd,10,"“Gets ko na.”In a country like the Philippines, where everyone has an opinion on your body except you, this film hits a nerve that’s been aching for a long time. The way the film shows her struggle, the shame, the fear, the judgment, the dreams she’s forced to postpone, feels like a mirror held up to countless Filipina girls who had to grow up too fast. You can feel how her choices are never just hers; they’re tied to religion, family, and the weight of “dapat” at “bawal.”But what makes Sunshine beautiful is how it refuses to punish her for wanting more. For wanting herself.When she finally chooses her dreams, finally chooses herself and it doesn’t feel selfish. It feels like survival. Like finally stepping out of a shadow she never asked to stand under.This is a reminder that a woman’s future shouldn’t be treated like a sin.And that the sun doesn’t ask permission to shine… it just does.The best Filipino Film of 2025.",2025-12-01,4,0,watch,True

In this world, we need an ate like her, Dok Helena, and ate pharmacist who completely shows support no matter what her decisions, does not have malicious mindset and judgmental tendencies.

Sunshine's bravery for fighting for what she wants, her exercising her rights, and her choices are what young women of today should follow. It is important to see how women who plan to abort or did abort are NOT completely cruel nor sinners, as they also have a conscience and dilemma as they go through every consideration. Her conscience, being represented by ""bata,"" goes to show how she considered having her, but of course it all just boils down to her body, her choices, and her future. And the rights to have access in safe abortions does NOT only applies to rape victims but all WOMEN. ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE. AND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS HUMAN RIGHTS.

peachofferings,10,"Putangina, hanggang ngayon, ang daming lalaking nag-aakalang may karapatan silang magpasya para sa katawan ng babae. What stays with you long after Sunshine ends is how the film treats every moment as something pulled straight from real Filipino girlhood. You see it in the small, mundane ways Sunshine tries to keep herself together like the way she tightens her jaw during training to hide the panic creeping up her spine, how she forces a neutral expression when adults around her throw judgment disguised as concern and the humiliation of realizing everyone expects her to handle a crisis she never chose.Girls grow up by being punished for becoming women. Sunshine is still a teenager, but the moment her pregnancy becomes known, people start talking to her like she owes them maturity, penance, and accountability she was never taught to carry.When Pastor Jaime steps in, offering moral pressure, you can feel the room closing in on her again. Everyone wants her to be a mother. Everyone thinks they have the right to her future. Despite all that pressure, Sunshine’s refusal hits like a rupture in a system built to control her.",2025-11-30,1,0,watch,True

haziah,10,"[ system log : 001 ]user : haziah | age : 23status : active // processingI liked Sunshine because it speaks volumes about the lack of real sex education among teenagers—how so many are left to navigate consequences without ever being given proper knowledge, guidance, or protection. It shows how quickly people are forced into rigid sides—pro-choice or pro-life—without being allowed the space to exist as confused, scared, and human first. I didn’t like it only because Maris Racal’s acting was phenomenal—raw, restrained, and painfully real—but because the film chose to center understanding instead of judgment. It didn’t sensationalize the situation; it made you sit with it.I liked it because it treated the experience as what it truly is: a life-altering moment that cannot be simplified into slogans, morals, or online arguments. It showed how heavy one decision can feel when the world is already crashing down on you. I liked it because it refuses to make the audience comfortable. It doesn’t beg for sympathy, it doesn’t chase approval, and it doesn’t try to make itself digestible for everyone.And most of all, I liked it because it never tells you what the “right” answer is. It simply lays everything bare and lets you face it on your own. It allows you to choose what to feel, what to believe, and what to carry after the credits roll.Some people say it lacked something—especially in its length—that it should’ve been longer, that it ended too soon. But I don’t agree. I think it had to end exactly where it did. Because some stories aren’t meant to be over-explained. Some experiences don’t offer neat closures. The ending didn’t feel incomplete to me—it felt honest.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

Hindi ko masikmura kung gaano karaming babae ang dumadaan sa ganitong hirap araw-araw at nakakaramdam na wala na silang mapanghahawakan pa. At dadagdag pa sa pasakit ang ang mga lalaki, ang simbahan, gobyerno at mga sarado ang isip sa ganitong sitwasyon. Why is it that women have to suffer the consequences alone, with the whole world—heaven and hell—blaming them for what happened. A world that continues to place heavy pressure on a woman’s shoulders yet crucify them the moment they make a mistake. Society needs to be more forgiving to women who are trying their best to make and take up space without making them sacrifice their whole life and identity. Every woman is a Sunshine of their own, and I hope that they realize that their happiness, their life, their voices and choices matter.",2025-11-30,1,0,watch,True

The film captures that ache, the way society can be quick to moralize but slow to understand.For me, it felt like looking at a reflection of a system we’ve all quietly learned to navigate: the whispers, the shame, the institutions that pretend to help but rarely do. Yet in those heavy moments, you still see a girl trying to choose herself, even when the world insists she shouldn’t.it’s messy, raw, and painfully familiar… and that’s why it felt less like watching a film and more like remembering something you wish you could forget.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False

PRO-LIFERS.WOMEN'S RIGHTS SHOULDN’T BE SOMETHING TO BE DEBATED!“Hindi pa ako ready maging nanay” is already a valid reason for abortion. It’s her choice, not a moral issue for everyone to judge. Nakakalungkot noong ipinakita sa movie na ito kung gaano kalala ang situation sa public hospitals—kulang sa resources, walang safe at stigma-free options, mayroon pa ngang nanganganak na lang sa sahig dahil sa kakulangan sa mga tao at kagamitan. Kaya hindi nakapagtataka na for many women, the “safest” choice ends up being underground options, kahit sobrang risky. Mas ironic pa, kasi nasa paligid lang ng simbahan ang mga nagbebenta ng pamparegla, hilot, at kung anu-ano, tapos ang narrative ng church: “kung natukso ka, talo ka.” Kaya understandable that the “tukso” becomes sometimes the only lifeline for someone desperate. Women bear the brunt of the hypocrisy. That’s literally the only way a woman could access it. Hindi ko alam kung bakit kapag babae ka, ang daming bawal sa’yo. Pero hindi ka naman bibigyan ng reliable options.

Para sa'kin, purong-puro 'yung mga scenes, naipakita talaga 'yung reyalidad ng buhay pagdating sa mga taong katulad ni Sunshine, mga pangyayari na katulad ng sa kanya. Pati 'yung sitwasyon na nangyayari sa mga public hospitals, 'yung mga facilities na binabayaran natin gamit ang tax natin, ay hindi nila magawang maayos. May mga doktor pang kung umasta ay hindi sila propesyonal at napaka-condescending. It is the reality of life here in the Philippines. Napansin ko rin that hatred for abortion is rooted from patriarchy and religion, napakahirap maging babae kapag ito ang mga kalaban mo, 'no? Sa babae ang sisi, sa babae ang lahat ng kasalanan habang ang mga lalaki ay may tinatawag na ""free pass."" Sabi pa nga nila, ""Ba't ka kasi bumubukaka,"" o kaya naman, ""Kung sino-sino na lang kasi ang kinakalantari mo."" Those things are the representation of the mindset of those who deem themselves as religious, but for me, they are just a bunch of hypocrites. Men can even be erased from the picture, and women will continue being condemned. Fuck people with double standards. Our society is so hypocrite that 'yung mga tinatawag na ""pamparegla"" ay natatagpuan malapit sa labas ng simbahan. Gaano sila kamapanghusga sa mga babaeng may karapatan sa kanilang sariling katawan, ipinapakita 'yan sa paniniwala nilang biased at outdated. It is sad to think na kailangan pa ng mga kababaihan na mag-lean towards these illegal means just to afford being free, when in the first place, it is their right to have a legal, safer, and non-demoralizing way to abort when it means taking care of their body, preventing the unborn from having a miserable life, and just letting women have their right to bodily autonomy. It just shows na napaka-patriarchal ng batas, sumabay pa 'yang pagiging misogynistic ng lipunang ginagalawan natin.

baobeisaur,10,"this film doesn't just tell a story; it exposes a system. for that reason, it stands as one of the most important films ever made in the philippines. honestly, it deserves far more attention, discussion, and recognition. include it in school curriculums too if possible.you don't need tearful monologues, or dramatic breakdowns (not that there's anything wrong with them) to understand the full weight of sunshine's situation. the film uses restraint as its sharpest tool. the dim, muted visuals; the overwhelming noise of her environment; the way the camera locks her in the centre of the frame.. always boxed in, always between lines.. all emphasise how trapped she is by the social and religious stigma, and by a society that refuses to recognise abortion as a woman's right. the blurred backgrounds aren't just aesthetic; they reinforce her disconnection from the world around her. she doesn't have the luxury to care about anything beyond her immediate reality: herself, her dreams, and the looming consequences of every decision she faces.and that is the tragedy, sunshine is a young woman with ambition, yet she navigates a world that is unforgiving. she is asked to seek god's forgiveness for attempting to abort the baby, yet if god is understanding, wouldn't he understand that she is not ready, and that she acted out of necessity? with abortion vilified and access almost impossible, the film illustrates how society corners, isolates, and silences young mothers.. not with loud condemnation, but with quiet, crushing inevitability. it is a devastating portrait of how systemic and cultural forces conspire to limit women's autonomy, and a reminder of the human cost of denying choice.one of the most striking elements of the film, for me, is its gendered power dynamic. every character, without exception, imposes his own beliefs onto sunshine. urging her to keep the baby, citing legality, morality, or personal conviction. their ""advice"" is never about her well-being, it's about controlling her choices. the absence of a single moment where a man asks what she wants is not accidental, it reflects a broader social structure where women's autonomy is secondary to male authority.the women in the film, however, present a more nuanced spectrum. some internalise patriarchal norms and unintentionally reinforce them, but many others recognise sunshine's struggle immediately. they empathise not because they have the answers, but because they understand the emotional, economic, and social burden that falls disproportionately on women. their solidarity is quiet but powerful. a direct contrast to the coercive, dismissive tone of the male characters. the film ultimately critiques how systems built and upheld by men deny women agency, especially around reproductive choices. in a society where institutional and cultural norms consistently silence women, the film shows that women often became each other's only source of validation, understanding, and empowerment. no scene is waster. nothing is filler. every character is intentionally placed, each one shaping or limiting sunshine's decisions in ways that feel painfully real.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False

MARIS RACAL I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR GAME!Ang kwento, ang cinematography, ang emosyon!!! Sobrang raw and realistic from the familiar “jeje” song playing sa jeep pagsakay ni Sunshine, to the 13 yr old na nakaranas ng pang aabuso mula sa kanyang tito (talamak ang kaso ng incest sa pinas, thank u direk for highlighting that). Sa sobrang realistic pati ang inis ko kuhang kuha ng conservative doctor. Literally had to pause and say “Putangina” pag sabing “Baka yan pala ang magiging future presidente ng Pilipinas or ang makakagamot sa AIDS.”Ang pelikulang ito ay napakatapang. It had the guts to shine a spotlight on a longstanding issue sa bansa na lagi na lang inooverlook. It dare call out and address what Filipinos considered as taboo. And as someone who had a debate with her mom over dinner about abortion, this film is so special to me. “Hindi ka ba kinikilabutan?” were my moms’ exact words but I cannot blame her. Being a country deeply rooted in Christianity, where morals and teachings of the church are deeply ingrained in you ever since you were young, it is actually hard to speak freely about this things without the catholic guilt creeping up on you. Kaya ang laki rin ng significance ng pagdasal muna ni Sunshine before nya gawin. To ask the lord for forgiveness.Plus it doesn’t shy away from showing the state of the country’s public healthcare system. Nakakaputangina lang. Putangina ng gobyerno. Putangina ng sistema kung saan kailangan maging life-threatening situation ang pagpapalaglag. Banning abortion does not end it, it only makes it unsafe for women since it causes them to resort to underground means. And what an irony that one of those means can be found tucked under the shadows of the church (mga ale na nagbebenta ng pamparegla, u carry so much hope for these women). The very church that condemns it and shuns women who will even consider it. This film is a big step in understanding women’s bodily autonomy. Mas mahalaga pa rin ang buhay ng nagdadalang-tao. Lastly, Annika (the child symbolizing Sunshine’s future child) saying “Gets ko na” at the end is so so dear huhu. Bata pa ang bata para magkabata. She has her whole life ahead of her and god forbid a woman chooses herself and her dreams. Gets ko na, Sunshine. Gets ko na.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

It shows the harsh reality of how society constantly pressures women into motherhood, ignoring their dreams, their health, and their right to make decisions about their own bodies. The film doesn’t sugarcoat the pain physical, emotional, and mental—that comes with being trapped in a system that refuses to acknowledge their autonomy.What hits the hardest is how normalized this struggle has become, and how many are suffering in silence. Especially the story of rhed bustamante’s character. Grabe. 13 years old nag cacarry na ng baby ☹️ a child carrying a child. This is a message to all the people to talk more openly about abortion, to stop victim-blaming, and to hold those useless shitty ass irresponsible men accountable.

lustcry,10,"the premise alone is enough for me to give it a full rating. to come up with a movie about one of the most taboo topics in this predominantly catholic country—given how conservative almost everyone is about it, how it’s actively vilified and condemned, how those who seek it are treated as no better than murderers, and how women are left to fend for themselves and look for alternative ways, whether through an underground clinic, safe or unsafe, or a seller’s comforting words when you don’t even know if the medicine will work—is a huge feat. it has been long overdue, but this is already a big step for everyone. abortion is, and will always be, healthcare.film-wise though, i absolutely LOVE the color grading. i usually hate SOME filipino movies (omg i’m sorryyyy) because the coloring pisses me off (like ik we can do better). idk how to pinpoint what gives me the ick but,,, yeah. sunshine’s though was nice. and it was a delight to see bits of manila’s vibe. always shady, dirty, BUT well, that’s our country and i loved the actual showcase of it. there were some symbolism and stills of how ironic some scenes can be too!! nice touch :) from the pills next to the statues to the jeepney signs. the plot is predictable for me (re: what those kids are), but not in a bad way. it just shows that it’s working, and i feel seen. a lot of women will feel seen. not saying we went through the exact same thing, but generally, the gist of thinking your life is over, or will be if it does happen, because we don’t have a choice in the first place, and are expected to just live with it, is familiar. the amount of mental gymnastics people will spew about “the future of the children,” how they could be “the next inventor of a cure,” while never considering the mother, who has her own ambitions, who has to give birth, raise the child, and provide the system and support for their hypothesis to even happen… it’s all broken-record arguments. these are the usual lines they’ll say, and some of their reactions (doctors, friends, “partners”) really DO HAPPEN irl and it’s proof that the film is heavily based from real experiences, and well researched enough about the actual process people will go through (and went through) for this. here’s to shed light, to inform, and hopefully, to make people more open, thoughtful, and willing to give women the autonomy they deserve.mic drop",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

amp_mf,10,"SUCH AN IMPORTANT FILM!!!!During these times, we genuinely need more films like this. First, not only does it touch on the struggles of a young woman faced with an unwanted pregnancy. It also shows how easy it is for the men to rid themselves of the responsibility. Miggy DID NOT give a fuck about Sunshine. He wanted her to deal with it herself; he wasn't even going to give her money if she didn't threaten him. It was his fault that she got pregnant, and yet she has to suffer the consequences of their unprotected sex, which he insisted upon. Second, it is very important how this film shows that early/childhood pregnancies are not just because of young people's 'kapabayaan.' More often than not, young girls' pregnancies are results of sexual assault and rape by predators. I cried when I saw Mary Grace, even more when we were told she's just 13. JUST 13!!!!! She wasn't ""wreckless,"" she wasn't out there having sex with anyone; she was raped by her own uncle. And she's just expected to mother the child born out of such a horrific thing done to her?Third, it shows you just how important legalizing abortion is. It's already happening out there. People are selling abortive pills or concoctions. People are doing basement abortions, in unsafe conditions, without licensed doctors. It's happening and it's dangerous. Sunshine was hospitalized. Mary Grace almost died. If abortion was legal, none of this would've happened. These girls would've been safe and cared for.Again, what an important film! It also shows how abysmal the healthcare system is in the Philippines. Overcrowded hospitals, little to no financial support, etc.On top of that, phenomenal performances all around. Maris Racal was great. Jennica Garcia was, as usual, brilliant. Rhed Bustamante, you will always be a star.This might be the longest entry in my letterboxd rn.

benazapril,10,"Sunshine (2024) is the most needed Filipino film of our generation and the generations to come. Beyond the excellent storytelling and technicalities, the message it conveys in a predominantly Catholic & conservative country is a long-overdue revelation of the reality of women.The film opens conversations for the uncomfortable truth of human nature. This is not just Sunshine's story. This is also the story of every woman and every young girl who face the challenges of being silenced and whose rights are being dictated and stepped on by our society.Maris perfectly portrayed Sunshine as a woman who knows what she wants and realizes the power that she and every other woman should have.The rest of the cast realistically depicted the Filipino society that reflects their morals on the teachings of Christianity. Moreover, the two ""imaginary"" characters brought life to the film by displaying the faces behind the masked moralities our society tells us.As a child of unwanted birth and as an adoptee, I know deep in my heart how much I advocate for abortion. I will always side with what is just and right; the ability of women to have access to reproductive health and the power of women to make decisions for their own life.Maraming salamat sa tapang at galing mo, Direk Tonet.",2025-11-29,1,0,watch,True

corkis,10,"I watched this film with my very religious family. I didn't say a word the whole duration of the film— yet every few minutes, without fail, at least one of my family members would nag me about teenage pregnancy and promiscuity.

I'm 15, they don't even let me watch movies with sex scenes on the family tv. (but obviously i still do watch movies beyond my age rating) The overbearing nature of religion is truly a problem in the philippines; and among our people, the vast majority of our country is made up of catholics, and it seems like the state is sometimes one with the church because of that fact. I commend this movie for being a step in the right direction. It's showing the true nature of these things to our often ignorant and close-minded society.

It is more infuriating to know that this also includes children as young as 13. Though this inclusion in the film may seem minor, it actually emphasizes that not being able to be given a choice to our own body steals our futures away.I also liked the nuances and subtle details that made this film feel more humane and relatable, including the motto etched on the Jeepney Sunshine rode when she found out she was pregnant, which was “GIFT OF GOD.” Hands down, Maris Rascal nailed this role.

jelieloop,10,"Gets ko si Sunshine.This film really captures me the most. As a woman who grew up in a most conservative country and a religious family, I feel the comfort of the movie. I know that tackling this kind of topic would raise brows to the people especially the one who’s spirituality believes that a women shouldn’t undergo abortion even if she really didn’t want to bear the child. Actually, it’s even funnier that this country preach that abortion should ban but the truth is there is a lack of education about sex, abortion, and contraceptives. Additionally, it’s so hypocrisy and misogynistic that people really blame woman for getting pregnant but NOT THE MAN?! In fact, they are the ones who put babies inside the woman’s womb. I really learned so many lessons in the movie which open my mind to the struggles of a woman. It’s disappointing that people keep preaching what’s right or wrong but THEY NEVER HELP AND UNDERSTAND THESE WOMEN. The movie open my mind that abortion SHOULD BE LEGALIZE. Abortion ISN’T a sin, murder, nor crime. IT’S A HEALTH CARE. It’s NOT selfish. It’s okay.But it is just sad that the Philippines is not yet ready to understand and tackle this kind of topic. I get Sunshine. The guilt-tripping, shame, and misogyny are tackled in a best possible way to give the viewers assurance and comfort. Also, it gives reminder that Filipinos should really open their minds and change their mindset. Women didn’t deserve the shame, the hate, and mostly the expectations that have been throwing to them just because THEY ARE WOMEN. For fucking sake. WOMEN NEED SUPPORT NOT A FUCKING JUDGEMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO’S CLAIMING TO BE A SPIRITUALLY ACTIVE BUT CANNOT OPEN THEIR MINDS AND THINK RIGHT.I hope and wish that the government legalize abortion. It is not a shameful thing to do. It is not killing. It is a self-care — A HEALTH CARE. People should know and understand that.Overall, I really love the movie and it will have a special place in my heart.

This movie is so impactful, and it felt surreal as it is totally happening in this country right now. Kuhang kuha yung reyalidad sa bawat buhay ng mga Pilipino, sa mga babaeng pinagkaitan ng sariling desisyon sa kanilang sariling mga katawan. As a person who agrees about legalising abortion in this country/pro choice, the religious people who tried to convince Shine and even made her feel guilty about aborting her baby triggered me so much. Dahil lamang sa relihiyosong paniniwala, o konsensya? I get it, it is a sin and it is evil thing to do. But what's more evil is that producing an unwanted child out of guilt into this world. Sunshine wasn't ready to be a mother, she still has dreams to follow, and she has the right to make a decision for her own life, own good, and own satisfaction. Miggy didn't even felt responsible for that child. He only got scared of his pastor father who is also a manipulative religious man. Smh. Men will be a horndog and disappear, yet it's their sperm that made that baby. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Yes, raw sex is pleasuring. But the thought or risk of producing a child habang hindi ka pa handa maging magulang ay dapat lamang na mas nangingibabaw sa kagustuhan mong masatisfy sexually. I hope people are aware of the consequences of their action before doing something because it's a big responsibility.I love this movie so much. Grabe kuhang kuha lahat, mga kaganapan sa maynila, mga black market, mga bawat sulok o tindahan sa quiapo, mga taong hindi nauubusan ng pag asa mabuhay sa kabila ng kahirapan ng buhay, mga batang kalye na nangangarap, at ang mga kinabukasan na naghihintay para sa kanila.I had goosebumps about Annika's representation in the movie. I thought she was the younger Sunshine 😭 I just realized that she's the child that shine could've had. Now I know why she always appears around her, and make her feel guilty, and understood her in the end.I love this movie so much! I hope this will be an eye opener to those imbecile peeps lol, and ofc the government. Abortion should be legal, especially if it'll be processed by the law too. Irresponsible people should not be punished by forcing them to keep the child. Because only the child will suffer throughout their lives. There are for sure a lot of an unwanted pregnancies situation, not only by not using condom but could be also by a failed contraceptives, or lack of knowledge about the reproductive system. Restricting abortion doesn't really promote responsibility—it just punished people for circumstances that are often beyond their control, and women will always be left with no choice but to abort an unwanted child in a harmful way.",2025-11-29,6,0,watch,True

It shows the weight of Sunshine’s struggle, the clash between personal pain, religious expectations, and society’s harsh judgment. The movie doesn’t shy away from the reality na hanggang ngayon, ang hirap mag-access ng abortion services sa Pilipinas dahil illegal pa rin ito.

2yaaa,10,"Hands down. One of the best filipino films I have ever seen.This deserves more than what I’ll write. More than the stars I’ve given. More than a mere category of ‘favorites’.This is worth talking about. The film I should see when tackling feminism. The film that shows how the Philippines lack support for its beautiful and brave women.Una sa lahat, fuck quiapo air. Quiapo—ang baho, ang sikip, ang init! Pero Quiapo… a place where you’ll find even the tiniest bit of hope, a place where even an ounce of solution can be found, a place where help exists, even if only through a few people.i also loved how fuckass men were portrayed in this movie. walang kwentang jowa, walang kwentang kapatid, walang kwentang tatay, walang kwentang tito, walang kwentang doktor. Tangina ang may kwentang lalaki lang ata rito is yung tricycle driver eh. Tangina ng mga lalaking ganyan. Patriarchy at its finest! Also, fuck women who let themselves be abused by this power. Yes, I’m talking about YOU nanay ni Mary Grace.as it progressed, onti-onti kong nararamdaman yung emotional sincerity ng film. yung dilemmas of decisions ni sunshine and yung heartbreaking truth about Mary Grace’s pregnancy. 13 years old pa lang siya? Yes, 13 years old pa lang siya. The movie refuses to romanticize their situation. instead, it leans into the uncomfortable truths of being a young woman in a society that praises discipline, resilience, and sacrifice yet offers little support when life derails. Director Jadaone shapes the film with a raw, documentary-like honesty: tight shots of silent breakdowns, stripped-down scenes with no dramatic score, and a narrative that mirrors the suffocating pressure placed on young Filipinas navigating taboo choices.Lastly, ang nagustuhan ko talaga sa film na to is the fact na the film didn’t fail to show and acknowledge the other women surrounding sunshine. women who, though not always in the spotlight, embody the many forms of pressure, expectation, and silent resilience that shape the world she moves in. they all carry their own versions of sacrifice: women praised for being disciplined, nurturing, and endlessly strong, yet rarely offered the same support they tirelessly give. like seriously? the maternity ward scene broke my heart so much 💔 seeing allthe women sharing the same beds also shows how fucked up our healthcare system really is. Tayo-tayo lang rin nagtutulungan. Tayo lang ang sumusuporta sa isa’t isa. Tayo lang mga babae. Kudos to that tindera. Ironic lang na sa harap pa talaga ng mga rebulto ni santo niño nagtinda ng pampalaglag 🤍 these kinds of religious beliefs shouldn’t really hinder us from doing what’s right and best for ourselves. and in showing these women’s quiet struggles, the film expands its emotional weight, reminding us that the story isn’t just about one girl’s burden but about an entire generation of women expected to endure everything while being thanked for it in silence. kulang pa tayo sa pansin, sa pagmamahal, at sa suporta. i hope that someday, all of us can finally feel how to live as a woman and be loved as a woman.",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

hellojaaack,10,"people often judge teenage pregnancy as the result of “giving in to temptation,” but this film shows the other side—not all teenage pregnancies are wanted or chosen. what i love about the film is how powerful it is; it resonates deeply with viewers and delivers a clear message consistently from start to finish.maraming sunshine sa lipunan—na biglaan, takot, at walang lakas ng loob na harapin ang pagiging ina—pero hindi ito usapin na masama ng tao si sunshine kaagad nang dahil lamang sa hindi pa siya handa. a moment of temptation is not enough reason to demand she accept her situation, as forcing a woman into parenthood before she is ready is a far greater mistake.i hope this film opens more eyes and highlights the need to strengthen reproductive rights in our country, recognizing that abortion is a right for all women. men who cause pregnancies rarely face the same scrutiny or shame; women, on the other hand, bear society’s judgment alone.abortion is not always chosen for pleasure—often it is the result of abuse or exploitation.it is heartbreaking that in the philippines, a case of violence against women is reported every 57 minutes. globally, over 30% of women—more than 737 million—experience abuse from partners or non-partners. many feel trapped, unable to leave because they are pregnant and have no right to terminate.in february 2024, save the children urged stronger reproductive rights in the philippines, noting that 35% of filipino girls under 15 became pregnant from 2021 to 2022—clear victims of abuse and exploitation. this is a critical issue that the government must address.women have the right to control their own bodies and make their own choices—regardless of religion, culture, or social pressure. they are often the most vulnerable and left behind in such situations.thank you to sunshine for her courage in standing up for herself and pursuing her dreams, and thank you to the film for portraying these realities.as i read somewhere, “marami ang hindi mapapatawad si sunshine dahil sa ginawa niya, pero sapat naman nang napatawad ni sunshine ang sarili niya.”",2025-11-29,1,0,watch,True

nikrang_done,10,"lahat ng tao ay may sariling ingay na tinatahak. sa pelikula, hindi lang ito ingay ng traffic o tambutso. ito yung ingay ng moralidad, ng tsismis, ng relihiyong mabilis magturo pero mabagal magmahal. ito yung ingay ng mga taong hindi naman mabubuhay sa katawan mo pero sila ang pinakamalakas magdikta kung ano ang dapat mong maramdaman, gawin, at piliin. at sa lahat ng ito, isang nineteen-year-old girl ang pasan ang mundo—a girl who should’ve been allowed to dream freely, pero sinasakal na ng lipunang takot sa kababaihang may sariling isip.isang bagay na ramdam mo agad sa pelikula: magkakampi ang mga babae. halos lahat ng karakter ay babae, at karamihan sa kanila may dalang munting piraso ng simpatya. isang kolektibong danas. isang unspoken sisterhood built on the multiple burdens that women carry: being caregivers, dreamers, breadwinners, shock absorbers of society’s cruelty. pero hindi rin romantisado ang pelikula—may mga babaeng kakampi, at may mga babaeng hindi. katulad ng doktor na ultraconservative, na nagpapaalala sa atin ng painful truth: hindi lahat ng babae ay mapagpalaya, at hindi lahat ng babae ay kakampi sa kapwa babae. minsan, ang mismong sistemang umaapi ay umiiral din sa mga babaeng natutong ipasa-pasa ang sakit.pinaka-mahalaga sa lahat: hindi totoong pagiging makasarili ang pagdedesisyon ng babae para sa sarili niyang katawan. kung may isang “gets ko na” moment ang sunshine, ito ‘yon. kung sarili lang niya ang iniisip niya, wala sana tayong ganitong pelikula. wala sana tayong ganitong lalim. pero ang totoo, bawat desisyon niya ay puno ng takot, pagmamahal, at pag-asa—lahat ng bagay na kinalimutan ng lipunan kapag babae ang may kailangan pumili.dito rin pumapasok ang simbolismo ng batang babae—ang unborn child, ang personified conscience. ariana is 13 y/o's own past self, her own fear, her own what-if. lahat ng interaction nila ay nangyayari “sa loob,” sa pinakatahimik na sulok ng isip ng babaeng hinahati ng daigdig. at nung ending, it’s for herself. the hug is acceptance. ang yakap na iyon ay tahimik na paglaya.pero kahit sa mundong pilit nagpapatahimik sa kababaihan, may irony na hindi kayang itago ang pelikula: sa isang konserbatibong lipunan, ang nagbebenta ng religious figures ay siya ring nagbebenta ng abortion pill. ang ob ay bigot. ang bahay ay hindi laging ligtas. ang simbahan ay humuhusga. at ang babae? wala man lang tunay na espasyo para huminga. bakit ang mga lalaki, may opsyon? bakit ang kababaihan, pilit pinapapili pero hindi ginagawaran ng tunay na choice?dito nagiging mas malakas si sunshine. hindi siya martyr. hindi siya sainted victim. she doesn’t just endure—she decides. she chooses herself kahit alam niyang bawat galaw niya may kasamang kurot ng panibagong judgment. she’s not fearless, but she moves anyway. at minsan, iyon na ang pinaka-matapang na pwedeng gawin ng babae sa bansang sobrang hilig kontrolin ang katawan at kinabukasan niya. dedma sa ingay. dedma sa prejudice. kung may pangarap ka, hawakan mo, kahit pa buong mundo pa ang naka abang na magkamali ka. ang sabi ni direk jadaone, ang pagbubuntis ay magbabago sa katawan ni sunshine, sa career niya, sa buong trajectory niya bilang atleta. at totoo—para kay sunshine, ang pregnancy ay literal career suicide. at dito umaalingawngaw ang tanong na gusto talagang ipukpok ng pelikula: bakit ba laging kababaihan ang kinakailangang magsakripisyo ng pangarap? bakit ang freedom ng babae ay laging conditional?kaya oo—decriminalize abortion. kasi ang autonomy ay hindi dapat ipinaglalaban, dapat innate. ang katawan ng babae ay hindi battleground para sa moralidad ng iba.in the end, sunshine reminds you that sometimes the bravest thing a girl can do is to choose herself, quietly, consistently, even when the world says she shouldn’t.",2025-11-29,1,0,watch,True

Really, this movie is so heavy for me—not in a negative way you know.

If they're going to keep abortion illegal, at least educate people properly to prevent it from happening, especially the guys, they should have consequences too. Women are more likely to be shamed than men because she's carrying the child, but the child is also part of the dad's dna.

cas_siana,10,"Love how the film depicts the harsh reality of what women have to go through just to be able to decide for themselves and their BODIES!! This movie really goes to show how making abortion illegal makes it so much harder and dangerous for women. It does not sanctify the value of life since in the first place the life of the woman is endangered. Moreover, I love how Manila gets depicted in this light, it shows the good and bad that comes with the city. It is bad for obvious reasons, the normalized chaos that is happening around it, how every night Sunshine is there, a mayhem ensues. However, I appreciate how Manila became a sanctuary place for her, where we can see how despite the chaos that happens every night, there are bits of humanity that saves her. The girl dun sa hotel, yung tricycle driver, and the 13-year-old girl that she met.Furthermore, I would like to commend the addition of having childrens act as her conscience or the ""what if child of hers"". It's a great addition because we can see how in the beginning of the film the girl was literally shouting ""murderer"" over and over again because in her perspective, her mother is harming her. But in the end when she said ""gets ko na"", it became a cathartic scene as it finally hits us that it isn't about being irresponsible and selfish ---- rather it is something more than that. The whole line of the girl saying to her friend Ariana that her dream is the same as Sunshine's is a great addition because I think it rings true with reality. As every now and then, when a child hears about the dreams of their parents and how they had to stop it to take care of their children, especially when it comes to Mothers, the child often feels bad and just wished that thier Mom was able to live out their dream first.Lastly, I love the relationship of sunshine and her older sister, the fact that never once pinagalitan o diniktahan ng ate nya sa kung paano nya haharapin yung sitwasyon niya goes to show how much she trusts and love Sunshine. I also love the contrast that all throughout the film there were different sides of the story whether labelling her as a ""murderer"" o miggy telling her to do what you got to do that once you reached the end scene when her sister just told her ""kahit ano maging desisyon mo kampi lang ako sayo"" made it soo impactful. Kase in the end yun lang naman ang kailangan niyang marinig, we have seen her face through that circumstance alone with nothing but her conscience, that the moment na sinabi sa kanya yun, it became a relief to her as well as allowed her to finally tell someone or at least cried it out to them na natatakot din siya kase nga bata din siyaa and hindi pa siya ready maging nanay. All in all, the film was a 10 out of 10, and I appreciate how the film wasn't all in the face about what you should believe in and what you shouldn't. It just presents Sunshine's story and her decision which should be acknowledged because hindi dapat humantong sa isang sitwasyon na mas uunahin pa ng isang doktor ang kaniyang lisensya kesa sa buhay ng isang tao dahil lang ""nagpalaglag"" siya. If you really value life in its essence then we should also acknowledge the life of the person carrying the baby so bakit niyo papabayaan lang na mamatay yung batang 13-year-old???????? so in conclusion:TANGINAA NG MGA LALAKETANGINA MO MIGGYTANGINA NUNG DOKTORATANGINA NUNG LALAKING DOKTORTANGINA NUNG TITO TANGNIA NUNG WALANG KWENTANG NANAY (?) - di nya deserve matawag na nanay",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,True

jystique,10,"Holy shit, this film had me in tears. Not only is it extremely well made, the cinematography and the characters were so raw that it had me stressing over them. I have never rooted for anyone so much to get rid of that damn baby. The movie also shows the darkest sides of the healthcare system in the Philippines, religion, and most of all, fucking men. It is unfortunate that us Filipina women have it the fucking worst. Not only are we in a third world country where it is illegal to abort, but we are guilt tripped over and over again by society to not choose ourselves. We are literal machines for them to procreate and forget ourselves in the process. We are not human to them.Right from the get-go it is shown how unprepared (who I assumed is 20) 20 year old Sunshine is. Even when she is cleaning up her sister’s child, she raises her hand as if to scare the child, when the child clearly does not understand this gesture. The men in this film are shown to be no help at all, may it be sibling, the boyfriend, the men in the streets, every. single. man. The concept of birthing a child will never be their problem, it will never even cross their minds. I love how realistic the scenes were when all the pregnant were all together, aiding each other and comforting each other; that is the harsh truth— men will never know the connection us women have with one another. Even if they are strangers.Rhed (Mary Grace) is the exact reason why abortion should be legalized in the Philippines. Young women subject themselves to improper medical procedures because that’s all they have access to (and hardly)— they do not know the severity of what their bodies will go through. In the first place, sex education is still frowned upon in the Philippines. God, I really hate, HATE how religion proves time and time again that they are the main reason why we cannot progress as a society. This film is beautifully filmed, I loved every bit of it. My heart sank deeper whenever she struggles, but the weight lifts whenever she chooses herself. Ladies, please choose yourself, above everyone else.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,True

Gets na gets ko—and I hope many more people will get it, too. This film struck a deep chord with me. Nearly every scene felt like it could happen in real life—and in many cases, it truly does.Abortion is treated like a sin in this godforsaken conservative and dominantly Catholic country. Many people disagree, but it really doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. In the end, the decision should be up to the woman who’s pregnant. We shouldn’t have an opinion—just understanding is enough. After all, it's her body, her life, her future, her choice. That's why I'll always firmly believe that abortion should be legal and safe. There are women—and even girls—who are far too young, forced into pregnancy, still unstable, still trying to build their own lives, and completely unprepared to raise a child while chasing their dreams. Abortion is healthcare, and access to it is a basic reproductive right.This film captures that reality so loudly. It’s loud with the streets of Manila, with people’s judgment, with hypocrisy. You can hear it all so clearly—the way society pushes women toward unreliable and dangerous methods like pamparegla in Quiapo or hilot, simply because abortion is condemned and proper reproductive healthcare is lacking. It’s so fucked up and heartbreaking. Tangina, ang hirap-hirap maging babae sa bansang ’to—sa mundong ’to.'Yung scene na walang filter na ipinakita ang estado ng public hospitals—mga serbisyong galing sa buwis ng tao pero hindi nila kayang ayusin—sobrang sakit panoorin. Sobrang bulok ng sistema natin. And there’s probably something even worse behind it—we are so fucked.So when Sunshine finally went through with the abortion, I felt relieved. For a moment, I was scared she might keep the baby. Bringing a child into the world when you’re not ready—and being forced to give up your own dreams because of it—is one of the most cruel things you can do to yourself and to that child.

FUCK YOU BOBOT!! now lets talk about the people who supported sunshine along the way, starting with her sister. Honestly, with how close they were i was really surprised that sunshine never told her. all of their scenes were just so heart warming and it really just felt so comforting. i feel like she was someone that sunshine really needed at the time and yknow those words probably meant so much to sunshine. i got a little teary eyed during that scene cuz it was just so 🥹next, the doctora. notice how it was a woman who risked her lisence and did everything to save the pregnant girl? yeah, thats what i call girlhood 😎 but yeah, i was just so happy that someone, an actual stranger, reached out a helping hand. even though she had very little screentime, i really enjoyed her character and it really just showed that there are still some good people out there.moving on, we have the pregnant girl. her hug with sunshine absolutely made me cry. idk, maybe seeing someone going through the same things as her just brought some comfort like atleast theyre both in this together. her almost dying made me feel something, it was either goosebumps or just deadass misery.. i guess a HM would be the coach. (no i am not mentioning the kid cry about it 😒)overall, this was such a beautiful movie. i felt everything and it just captured the life of a filipina so well. just shows how much one person could be going through and how much a woman has to do to simply get rid of her baby. def watch this if you have time!!",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,True

Pero sa interpretation ko, Anika represents Sunshine’s younger self, the child she used to be...nandoon s'ya sa mga moments na lost si Sunshine, parang comforting presence The film isn’t about Sunshine being pregnant at a young age. Instead, it serves as an eye-opener to the difficult realities in the Philippines, youth forced into responsibilities too early, lack of guidance, and the fear and shame surrounding conversations about teen pregnancy and reproductive health, like, the need for safe, accessible, free reproductive care. Hindi ito tungkol sa pag-encourage ng abortion, but about recognizing that young girls deserve proper education, protection, and safe options. Walang kabataan ang dapat mapahamak dahil sa kakulangan ng tamang impormasyon(edit)Omg, bigla ko lang narealize after everything: nung nakilala ni Anika si Arianna, tapos bigla siyang nawala nung nag-success yung abortion ni Rhed Bustamante… doon ko na nakita yung deeper symbolism.

Films that would make you reflect on your values, remember similar scenarios that evoked the same sentiment, or spark a different approach and a deeper kind of empathy for those going through the same plight.Madami akong babaeng kapamilya na Sunshine, Ate, Thea, Dr. Helena, even yung nanay ni Ariana.As a film watcher na plot driven ang hanap most of the time, I did not expect this to be see through/transparent. Gets mo na agad eh.Ang ganda.Ang sakit.Sa mundong masahol, thank you for Direk Tonet and Maris for giving your all for this movie. 🥹",2025-11-28,0,0,rewatch,False

And yeah, even with her recent scandal (which I’m not even getting into lol), you cannot deny how talented she is. The girl can ACT, period.Second, this movie really shows the reality for so many Filipino women. It’s wild how we’re constantly being robbed of our choices. Religion getting shoved down our throats every five seconds, the government acting like women’s health isn’t even part of their job. Sometimes it really feels like the PH is just… anti-women. And it’s honestly so frustrating. I just hope things change soon, because it’s not about religion or “morals” all the time. It’s about actually having the choice, the chance to do what’s right and do it safely. Not end up risking your life because you had no real options.This is lowkey turning into a whole debate, but whatever. I really hope this movie opens people’s eyes.

EVERYTHING was genuinely perfect for me idc.this is something that the majority of the philippines can’t stomach watching and that’s probably partly why i feel glad that it was still publicized / made into a film in the first place. some scenes made me cry so much and i guess it mostly stems from the feeling of finally seeing something of this caliber be embedded in filipino film and showing the culture of our country as accurately as possible. it’s cathartic to watch something good especially when it feels like home.trust that this movie has engraved itself in the corners of both my mind and heart.",2025-11-28,1,0,watch,True

alyssalelis,10,"Entry #2, less of a movie review and more of a rambling on how this movie helped trigger a reflection on how I process my own emotions as a woman haha.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Sidenote, but there's something abt Sunshine's self-restraint that makes me want to cry.When she finally confronts Miggy, she doesn't start beating him up or screaming at him. Instead, she simply says that she's pregnant, as if she should be ashamed that she needs to talk to Miggy about it.And you can see why, the moment her frustrations start bubbling up, Miggy tells her to calm down. Miggy even leaves before he gets a full taste of her wrath.Oh my god. It reassured me so much that people who hold themselves back during confrontation aren't any less brave, or deep, or strong. It's just that we've been societally conditioned to always be the better person. Always consider the emotions of the person you're talking to.And maybe, much like Sunshine, I know it's a hopeless cause.It echoes how I've dealt with family and situations I've felt misunderstood by. Why communicate with someone who can't be communicated with? Why escalate the situation? Why be vulnerable with someone who doesn't know how to handle it? Yung nasa debate team ako, at ang hahaba haba ng letterdbox reviews ko, pero kunting sigaw lang sa akin natatameme na ako. It's especially disappointing when you've already communicated with them in the past and they don't change. Sabay na sa sakit ng concern mo yung kahihiyan ng pag-express mo ng damdamin sa wala. Sabay na yung disappointment na hindi humihigit pag-ibig nila sa bad habits nila. (LUH, SAAN YON NANGGALING COUGH COUGH)And what's left is I leave those situations much like Sunshine, with so many unsaid words and emotions bubbling underneath the surface that I want to smash someone's car. Even my unsaid thoughts get clouded by me almost instinctually trying to put myself in the other person's shoes, or trying to understand where I went wrong and how to do better next time. Then suddenly, even in the privacy of my own headspace, I can't process my own emotions. Suddenly, even long after the moment has passed, I feel less whole and less human.I was raised to never raise my voice. And I have a subtle respect yet envy for women who do. A small, conservative part of my brain goes, ""You know we're not allowed to shout, right? Why can't you be the better person?""But maybe it IS possible to strike a balance between communicating your concerns with someone and still being sensitive with their emotions.Maybe it's not such a hopeless cause.",2025-11-28,0,0,rewatch,True

A reminder that a woman is never selfish for choosing herself, and will never be selfish for choosing herself. Because at the very beginning, her life starts with a choice — and that choice is her.I hope more people watch and reflect on this film, because it shows how the Philippines continues to move backwards when it comes to reproductive health. How many Filipinos still choose to remain blindsided, choosing stigma over understanding, especially on abortion “in the name of religion.” How a patriarchal society still insists on having the final say over a woman’s body — when in truth, they NEVER SHOULD HAVE in the first place.

yunqoui,10,"I have a lot of feelings to share about this beautiful and heartbreaking film. Truly a big eye-opener to many Filipinos.Women carry a biological physical pain we are given the moment we are born. Period, childbirth, postpartum, etc. But we also carry the pain this world and men cause. The pain men should be held accountable for. Emotional labour, cultural and religious expectations, rape, pregnancy, forms of abuse, etc. It's like our suffering is pre-written, pre-approved, and expected. And yet the world still has all the audacity to treat us as if we're lesser, fragile, dramatic, overreacting. I think I will never be able to understand the logic of a world that demands strength from women and then punishes us for being strong.Like Sunshine and Menggay, a lot of women out there don't have choices. A lot of women are already deprived of basic rights before they even learn to speak. But then again, society still keeps finding new ways to take more from them.The hypocrisy of the Filipinos in this film is also insane but couldn’t be more well depicted. (It’s actually so much worse in real life.) Filipinos will praise God with one hand and strip women of autonomy with the other. Anti-abortion because “God said so,” but silent about abuse, poverty, rape cases, or the girls forced into motherhood long before they even have the chance to understand themselves. They defend unborn children better than they defend the living women who have to endure the burden of carrying them. Because if they don’t, you will judge them. You will shame them. How is that love? How is that morality? Abortion is criminalized, but sexual abuse cases get dismissed.It’s exhausting. It’s enraging.To all of the Sunshines out there, gets na gets ko kayong lahat. The world keeps underestimating and shaming us, but here we are, still standing, still surviving.To end this, I want to share that one monologue in Fleabag that came back to me after watching this film and inspired my entire review:""Women are born with pain built in. It's our physical destiny—period pains, sore boobs, childbirth. We carry it within ourselves throughout our lives. Men don't. They have to seek it out. They invent all these gods and demons so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we do very well on our own. And then they create wars so they can feel things and touch each other and when there aren't any wars they can play rugby. We have it all going on in here, inside. We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years, and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes. The fucking menopause comes and it is the most wonderful fucking thing in the world. Yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get fucking hot and no one cares, but then you're free. No longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts. You're just a person.""",2025-11-28,2,0,watch,True

lowbitrae,10,"Gets.I was gonna leave it there but I have thoughts so full steam ahead—Manila is a staple in almost every Filipino film, being the capital and all, but rather than the large city itself— Sunshine specifically captures the essence of Quiapo so well. The bustling markets, the overcrowd and kids begging for alms, and religion is embedded everywhere— whether it be its churches, the posters within the buildings, street stalls selling rebultos and rosaries, or the people themselves. I don't usually care for the setting of the story but I always think it's smart when it actually helps drive the narrative forward, so I find this neat little aspect of the film amusing (also, while we're at it, props to whoever the prod designer is wow). I watched this at 3AM during a vigil so I had all the time to read other reviews and can I just say, while I understand how it could be viewed as such— I don't think this film was didactic or propaganda. I love films that open conversations and Sunshine opened a lot, but more than the conversations it opened, I love how the center of it has always been women. The heart of Sunshine is Sunshine herself, and Maris Racal definitely gave the performance of a lifetime in this one. The fact that she filmed this the same time as Can't Buy Me Love is insane, talk about range.Also, props to Direk Tonet 'cause I have only watched this film a day before, but it is so dear to my heart.

Kasi nung sinabi niya 'yon, we also did—na-gets na rin natin.the implied abortion was symbolic for me kasi aside from sunshine reaching her dreams (to compete), it also shows the contrast of her (sunshine) experience to Rhed's. Kasi deba, Rhed's abortion experience was done illegaly, while hers was a second try pero done by an actual professional. it is implied, but it shows the two endings of getting an abortion. Na kaya naman pala sa maayos at ligtas na paaran para mag pa-abort. This is the result if abortion is legalized here in the Philippines.

Some beliefs are held as non-negotiable, no matter how liberal or progressive the world becomes. But the reality for women like Sunshine is that restrictive laws can make life dangerous.Morality, legality, and lived experience are not the same. Laws may make something illegal, but they don’t erase the underlying reality or the demand for care and safety. Sunshine’s story embodies this tension. She had access to a supportive family and a thriving career as gymnast, yet the illegality of abortion forced her into danger. Clearly, a systemic failure.People will always find ways to survive, and without proper regulation, it becomes deadly. The existence of quack clinics, “hilots,” and underground networks is proof of systemic neglect, not moral failure of individuals.I hope many legislators, lawmakers, leaders, or whatever we call them, see this film.",2025-11-27,0,0,rewatch,True

Dare I say the most important film of our generation? And Maris holy shit, that was one of the best performances I’ve seen in the last ten years. Raw, terrifying, and painfully real.I know I’ll never fully understand the complexities of what women go through, and that’s exactly why films like Sunshine hit this hard. They ground us in stories that have always existed, stories that deserve to be acknowledged, stories that some films, especially in the Philippines, hesitate to touch.Sunshine doesn’t just tell a story, it makes you feel it in your chest. It sits with you, heavy and unshakeable. And maybe that’s the point, to leave you changed, even just a little, and to make sure these truths are never brushed aside again. And if cinema has any purpose at all, it's to let us feel the world through someone else's skin, even for just a moment.Philippine healthcare is genuinely fucked. We’ve talked about it for years, we scream it straight into their faces, and still, nothing changes. But good fucking god, when will this finally get better?

talixcx,10,"‎A woman is more than a mother and a wife. A woman can have a life, passion and dreams other than giving birth and creating a family. A woman can desire a life of her own without a child in the picture. She has a brain, a heart, and a soul that can yearn for a greater life; she is more than just her womb. And that is fine, if a woman decides to prioritize her own ambitions instead of being chained to traditional norms, then so be it— it's her life. ‎‎We should never push our own values and ideals to someone that is living their own life. If they're not ready for a child, they aren't. A living and breathing woman's choice should speak louder than an unborn, lifeless fetus. Even if their decision is against our principle, at the end of the day, it is healthier to have them choose than seeing them losing it all together. ‎‎Women are already suffering from a lot of judgement, abuse and maltreatment on the daily; the least we need is people dictating our choices and deciding our own lives for us—Let alone having people that know nothing about a woman's body making the rules.‎‎Napaka-imposible mabuhay nang madali bilang babae sa mundong ating ginagalawan ngayon.

jolsf,10,"First of all, I know that this movie premiered at the 49th Toronto International Film Festival in 2024 and arrived in Philippine cinemas 4 months ago. And now that it finally dropped on Netflix… I hope I’m not too late to say it finally: This movie is powerful 😭💯Antoinette Jadaone delivers one of her most fearless films yet with ‘𝗦𝘂𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲’ — a coming-of-age sports drama that hits with quiet power and emotional honesty.Maris Racal plays the titular character, a young gymnast on the road to the Olympics. Her world revolves around discipline, repetition, and the dream of making it to the competition she’s trained her whole life for. But when she discovers she’s pregnant, her perfectly controlled world cracks open.What I loved about the film is how it never sensationalizes her situation. Sunshine’s fear is treated with quiet realism. The movie acknowledges how complicated teenage pregnancy is, especially in a society where abortion, reproductive rights, and bodily autonomy remain heavily stigmatized and often misunderstood.These themes are controversial. And yes, the movie will divide people. But ‘𝗦𝘂𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲’ refuses to look away from the truth: 𝘔𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘍𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘴 𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘨𝘨𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦. 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘺 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦 𝘦𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘵𝘩𝘺, 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘫𝘶𝘥𝘨𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵.Maris is phenomenal here. She carries the entire emotional weight of the story with a performance that feels painfully real. She rarely breaks down on screen, but you think her internal collapse in the smallest expressions — the breath she holds, the way she avoids eye contact, the way she pushes her dream forward while everything else is falling apart.𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲.The supporting cast — particularly Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, and Xyriel Manabat — also elevate the film, each representing a different kind of pressure or support Sunshine faces. And yeah, some male characters in the movie definitely got what they deserved. 😅Jadaone’s direction is quiet, patient, and uncomfortably close — exactly how it should be. The movie lets us follow Sunshine’s anxiety and feel the suffocating pressure she’s under.One of the film’s boldest artistic choices is the recurring appearance of a mysterious girl who seems to follow Sunshine. At first it’s confusing, then a bit eerie, then surprisingly emotional. I won’t spoil anything, but when the film finally reveals who she represents… 😭. It’s symbolic, heartbreaking, and adds a deeper emotional layer to Sunshine’s arc.Beyond the gymnastics, beyond the controversy, Sunshine is really about choice — and how young women often aren’t given the space to empower themselves to make their own choices.The movie conveys important messages: your body is your own; silence can mask the deepest struggles; the pressure to be perfect is harmful; pursuing dreams matters, but so is ensuring one's survival; kindness fosters safety, while judgment breeds fear; and young women need safe spaces. The movie doesn’t push a specific viewpoint — it drives for humanity.Overall, ‘𝗦𝘂𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲’ is brave, heartbreaking, and painfully relevant. It does not shout — it whispers truths that hit even harder. Indeed, it’s a film that mirrors reality for many young women today, and one that our society needs to see, even if the conversations it starts are uncomfortable.With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…9/10! ⭐️ (Woooo!)",2025-11-26,1,0,watch,True

direktorscut,10,"Sobrang hirap maging babae. Lalo na, maging Pilipinong babae.Sunshine is by far my favorite Filipino movie. The casting is phenomenal—Maris is an incredible actress—and the cinematography perfectly captures what it feels like to live in a third-world country where women’s health is treated as one of the least priorities.Growing up, I always knew how hard it was to bear a child. All three of us siblings were delivered through cesarean section, to the point that my mom was in critical condition. My father had to choose who to save between me and my mama. But even with that knowledge, I never fully understood the depth of how difficult it truly is to be a woman—especially in a predominantly Catholic country where family and faith are held above everything else.Being a woman—a Filipina woman—means constantly choosing between survival and expectation. I think now we are so comfortable discussing how a modern Filipina should break molds and create her own path. There is so much manifestation that now, more than ever, these cages should be dismantled. I don't want to say this, pero hindi pwedeng dahan-dahan tibagin ang problemang kumakahon sa kababaihan, because women should not endure when all their lives they are expected to survive.We honor the Church, follow tradition, and protect the image of being a “good woman,” even when those expectations silently hurt us. Even though I am pro-choice, I still feel slightly uncomfortable talking about abortion (because of how I was raised). And this topic is so important. This topic is so necessary, especially since most of our laws are anchored sa Katolisismo. Maging ang moralidad ng buong bansa ay nakabatay sa kung ano ang turo sa Bibliya. The truth is, women are left with no choice. They have no privilege to say “ayaw ko maging nanay,” which leads them to do “illegal procedures” because, again, women’s health care has long failed us. The very system that is supposed to prepare and free us is the one that is caging us. We shouldn’t just look at this problem from a biblical perspective (notice how Sunshine went to the church after knowing she’s pregnant at 19?), not when the Church itself has been one of the loudest forces shaping the silence around women’s bodies. The problem begins when morality is dictated without considering lived realities—when doctrine is treated as absolute while women bleed, struggle, and navigate dangers that society refuses to acknowledge.And that’s the heartbreaking truth: Judgment is more accessible than proper healthcare. We preach compassion from the pulpit yet withhold it from the very women who need it most. I may not be the most religious person in the room, but I know my God. And He will never let me or anyone suffer from a torture.This is why conversations about reproductive rights are not just political—they’re personal, urgent, and life-changing. When a woman, like Sunshine says “ayaw ko maging nanay,” she’s not being irresponsible. She’s being honest. But in this country, that honesty is treated as immorality. Women are pushed into silence, into shame, and into dangerous choices because the system refuses to give them safe ones. Walang point ang socially established morality mo kung selective lang ang application nito.We owe it to women to dismantle these cages not gently, but urgently. Because for generations, they’ve endured quietly. For generations, they’ve survived what they should never have had to face alone.And maybe that’s why Sunshine hurts so deeply. Because it’s not just a story. It’s a mirror of what we still refuse to fix.",2025-11-26,0,0,watch,True

ra11nview,10,"Direk Tonet Jadaone, come get your Baddie chain!Having lived in the City of Manila during my university days has shown me the city after dark [winks]. Seeing the city through Jadaone's lens takes me back to watching the classics of the '70s and '80s where we see Manila as the place where people begin to reach their dreams. We can see that with Sunshine's rehearsals and training routines in Malate's Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. She has become an Asian Games champion here, and she has started dreaming of becoming an Olympian here. That's Manila, the City of Dreams.But, similar to Bernal's Manila By Night (1980) and Brocka's Maynila sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag (1975), we get to explore the dreadful city in its raw, authentic form. We see this as we walk together with Sunshine through the hazy streets of Downtown Manila during the day and the grimy pillars in Morayta's streets where prostitutes wait for clients at night. The film doesn't tackle these aspects of the city and just shows them as they are through guerrilla-esque filmmaking. It's just enough for the viewers to see the situation Sunshine and other Manileños are in. It might also be that, after decades of instability in the Capital, people already know that Manila is no longer what it used to be, so there's no need to explicitly discredit Manila's reputation anymore.And of course, when a young, unmarried Filipina gets pregnant in a movie, it's obvious that the film will touch on Christianity in the Philippines. We see the Catholic guilt Sunshine faces, the hate-filled Christian love that out-of-touch Filipinos have, and the deeply-ingrained consequences of colonialism to the Philippine society. Unfortunately, this isn't something new. This has been going on for centuries already, and has been a topic in Philippine cinema for decades.However, this film offers a more modern take using a sports drama. Maris Racal delivers what is undoubtedly the best performance by a Filipino actor this year so far. We can feel her desperation to fulfill her lifelong dream as an athlete to reach the Olympics. Whether or not you're someone who is against abortion, you will be forced to empathize with her dilemma because of how compelling she is.What I also like about the movie is it's not just some liberal self-help nonsense that just ""wants to raise awareness"" about an important issue. This film also challenges the worldview of religious conservatives. It will force people to ask themselves questions like:To what extent do women have to be forced to give birth to a child they don't want to have?What if she's a victim of incest?What if she's a rape victim?What if a pregnancy puts her life at risk?What if she can't afford to give a decent life for her child?What if she's not yet ready to be a parent?What if she simply doesn't want to be a mother?And, in the end, the film stands firm on what it believes in. It's so rare to see a Filipino movie be so unapologetic in its message and still get this much traction. I hope this opens the door for more movies that will boldly discuss controversial issues head-on because that's what we need.This film is outstanding, a real body of work. This cements my view of Jadaone as a filmmaker you can always trust to make good movies, and of Racal as an actress who will lead the next generation of stars. They're the future of Philippine cinema.",2025-11-26,1,0,watch,True

nssue,10,"really loved watching sunshine. everything felt so real the acting, the places, the whole atmosphere. it really showed manila the way people actually see it every day: crowded streets, smoky air, tight alleys, small stalls everywhere, messy and honest.in sunshine, you follow a young gymnast who dreams of joining the national team. but right before her big try-out, she finds out she’s pregnant, and her whole life suddenly shifts. all the things she was working for feel like they’re slipping away.the movie doesn’t hide the harsh parts of her situation. she ends up looking for illegal abortion pills from sketchy vendors near church stalls, which shows how desperate people can get when safe options aren’t available. you also see how people look at her, the judgment, the shaming, the assumptions.one thing that really stood out was the little girl in the film. she felt like a symbol, almost like a reflection of innocence or the childhood the main character is losing too quickly. the little girl also shows how young women are expected to handle things way beyond their age, carrying responsibilities and pain that should never have been theirs in the first place. she represents the younger version of so many girls who grow up in harsh realities, where choices are limited and voices are ignored. the little girl is a reminder of what could’ve been and what gets taken away too soon.through all of this, sunshine makes you think about real issues. what happens to young girls who get pregnant and have no support? what if they’re too young, or not ready, or simply trying to survive? what if they’re judged instead of helped?overall, sunshine felt raw and honest. no sugarcoating, no pretending, just real life, and that’s what makes it hit so hard.",2025-11-26,1,0,watch,True
zzzeiayam,10,"Naiintindihan mo na?Gets ko na.At first I thought Annika's role was to portray Sunshine's inner child but of course as the movie progressed I realized what actually Annika's character represented. I also noticed how since Mary Grace was carrying her unborn child longer than Sunshine, Ariana already had a name meaning Mary Grace probably already thought & pictured giving birth to him knowing she didn't really have a choice after being sexually harassed at 13 years old by her mom's lover. While Sunshine only called Annikas's character Bata, showing how most probably from the beginning she knew what her choice would be therefore why she never thought of a name.A woman is often judged automatically once she considers abortion, she is often called names, and is labeled. Sunshine represents all the women who has already made up their minds, yet is still conflicted. Throughout her experience, she was consumed with guilt & doubt as she knows the weight that comes with even only thinking of what she's about to do but it's either that or sacrificing her dream, her only dream. People often judge quickly and forget that even when a young woman seems to easily decide to get rid of her baby, it's hers. What I mean to say is that, once a woman has an abortion she's not merely getting rid of a clump of cells, she's sacrificing a part of herself; a possibility, a what could've been.Sunshine was haunted with the thought of her child being angry and dissapointed at her for what she's about to do but as time went on and when she rehearsed her routine as she gave it her all whilst preparing for the Olympics, she is reminded why & from there she knew, that her child would've understood and that she's made peace with herself.This film excellently portrayed the unfortunate reality many young women & even children, are experiencing in our country — all around the globe even. As I continue to write this review, the messages in the film remain present & true as I write this with a bit of doubt & guilt because I'm supposed to agree with the doctor that judged Sunshine right? Because in the bible it is a sin? Is it wrong that if I was with Sunshine I would've supported her decision? Sure, I wouldn't have encouraged her but I would've supported her nonetheless. That alone is proof how behind we are, not only from healthcare services to proper maternity wards but how we, as a Catholic country, continue to enforce our beliefs to individuals who clearly don't share the same belief.It is unfair how men like miggy & that uncle get to continue to live normally after what they did. Sure, they'd be guilty but when the time comes it isn't them who'll be lying on a hospital bed as an attempt fails or as a child is birthed; it isn't them who'll be conflicted to sacrifice their dreams nor is it them who'll be scrutinized and judged by everybody.May Sunshine be a reminder that it isn't selfish to choose yourself. In fact, to birth a child with an irresponsible father whilst being unstable in all aspects of yourself is more selfish of an act than choosing not to give birth.",2025-11-26,0,0,watch,True

Ewan ko, ang hirap manganak, ang hirap maging nanay, at ang hirap ng estado ng healthcare sa Pilipinas. Bukod pa roon, nandoon yung bigat tsaka ingay sa kabuuan ng palabas.

Sometimes loyalty is quiet, sometimes it’s all you can offer, and sometimes it’s the only thing that saves someone. I believe God forgives, and I believe He lifts people back up, but He often does it through the hands of those who refuse to leave.What unsettled me was the doctor turning a fragile moment into a moral lecture. A woman’s choice belongs to her — her body, her future, her weight to carry. That’s why I never argue about abortion. I don’t push beliefs. I don’t corner anyone into a “should.” I only guide, gently, and let them choose their own path.In the end, I saw myself in Sunshine or maybe the version of myself who hopes fiercely for others.

Men ruin everything and walk away untouched, while women are left with all the responsibility, all the judgment, and all the shame. We’re expected to endure, to forget, to move on, while they roam freely without consequence!!!And it makes me fucking furious—furious at men and the religious institutions that still believe they have the right to dictate what a woman can do with her own body. Women deserve choice, autonomy, and proper healthcare. We deserve dignity.

Maraming salamat Direk sa bawat dayalogong nakakapagbukas ng usaping madalas ay hindi napag-uusapan sa bansa. ---Sobrang galing na na portray nila ang Maynila lalo na ang bawat sulok ng Quiapo na lugar na puno ng kwentong ayaw pag-usapan. Quiapo na kahit saan ay may mga gamot at langis na bawal sa ""batas ng Dyos"".Bawat karakter sa Pelikula ay may role para sa kabuuan ng gustong ipakita ng pelikula;Si Sunshine na gagawin ang lahat para sa kanyang pangarap, ang ate niya na mirror kung ano ang hahantungin niya sa magiging desisyon niya sa bata, ang Pastor na personipikasyon ng matinding pananalig ng mga Filipino sa Diyos, si Dr. Helena at ang tindera sa Quiapo na nagbibigay pag-asa, at si Thea sa kung ano ang stigma ng bansa sa isyung ito. Madalas, ang tingin natin sa abortion ay ""kasalanan sa Diyos"" at ang teenage pregnancy naman ay ""kadiri"" pero kung ito man ang tingin ng karamihan sa bansa, bakit wala pa rin tayong ginagawang aksyon para rito? Bakit wala pa ring maayos at komprehensibong sex education lalo na para sa kabataan? Bakit wala pa rin tayong accessible healthcare, lalo na ang mga kababaihan,? at bakit wala pa ring karapatang mamili ang mga kababaihan para sa kanilang katawan? Maaring ang mga bata sa istorya ay ang personipikasyon ng konsensya nila Sunshine at Menggay, pero ang interpretasyon ko, sila ang ""what could have been"", ang mga buhay na maaring umusbong kung hindi sila nagpa abort. Maaring kaya't may pangalan si Ariana dahil sumagi sa isip ni Menggay ang buhayin ang bata, pero kaya't walang pangalan ang batang kasama ni Sunshine ay dahil simula't sapul ay alam niyang hindi pa niya kaya o gugustuhing maging ina (kahit na may mga oras na nagdadalawang isip siya). Kaya't may sariling pangarap si Ariana dahil maari siyang mabuhay. At ang pangarap naman ng bata, ay ang pangarap ni Sunshine, dahil mas malakas ang sigaw ng kanyang puso para tuparin ang mga pangarap na ito kaysa sa pagdadalawang isip niyang ipalaglag ang bata. Sa Bansang konserbatibo katulad ng Pilipinas mahirap pag-usapan at madalas ay iniiwasan natin ang mga taboo topics tulad ng aborsyon, relihiyon, r4pe, at kahit idolism politicians, pero katulad ni Sunshine, kailangan natin itong harapin. At katulad ni Sunshine, tayo ay mangarap, na mabuksan ang isip ng bawat-isa at magkaroon ng maayos na solusyon sa mga ito. Sa mga isyu katulad ng aborsyon, tayo ay may sari-sariling opinyon at ang bawat opinyon na ito ay may mga rasong mula sa mga karanasan, sariling paniniwala, at maski sa takot natin. Si Sunshine, ipinakita niya na hindi natin kailangang hanapin ang kung ano nga ba ang ""tama"" at hindi natin kailangang baguhin ang ating paniniwala. Kundi, Kailangan lamang natin buksan ang mga mata, puso, at utak sa bawat isyung ito at sa mga sitwasyon ng mga taong nakararanas nito.Sa huli, alam nating mas pinili ni Sunshine ang kanyang pangarap. Bago man makamit ito, maraming pagsubok ang kanyang dinanas, at marami rin siyang nalamang kwento na katulad ng sakanya. Hindi lamang nag-iisa si Sunshine!Maaring isang karakter lamang sa isang piksyon na pelikula si Sunshine, ngunit ang bawat eksena rito ay maaring naranasan na rin ng isang tao, at ang istorya ni Sunshine ay istorya ng lahat ng kababaihan.

Kuhang kuha yung magulo, maingay at masulasok na lugar ng Maynila, at partikular nito ay sa Quiapo. Ang ironic rin, na yung nagbebenta ng pamparegla or pampalaglag is the same na ale who's selling religious statues and relics. I love how it contradicts the situation. Kitang kita mo yung gustong ipahiwatig ng film throughout that specific scene alone. Ang galing lang talaga. Ang daming nangyari sa Quiapo. I would love to point out na true, sobrang pinoy ng actions ni Sunshine there. Iba yung tama ng bawat hakbang niya papalapit sa simbahan para humingi ng tawad, sa ale na nagbebenta ng pampalaglag, lugar na puno ng relihiyoso ngunit mapanghusgang mga tao, sa pagsira kuno ng kotse ng putanginang ex niya na wala man lang reaksyon nung sinabi niyang buntis siya, sa pagcheck in niya sa avenida inn. Tagos na tagos at damang dama ko yung emosyon ni Sunshine from the screen. Hindi lahat gusto maging nanay at tumayong maging magulang sa mga anak nila. Totoo naman.

Kidding aside, I've been in a huge movie slump for a long time and this was the only movie I wanted to watch in the cinema, and I wasn't able to do so. When I found out that it was coming on Netflix, it was the only thing that kept me going for the whole month. I'm so glad that I watched it. This just intensified my political rage because I've always wished that abortion was legal here in the Philippines.

But we could only hope. I love you Antoinette Jaodone, and Maris Racal. Fuck you Miggy, and fuck the men who can't wear condoms.

pussycake,10,"This film is a fucking masterpiece. It is a protest—a massive slap in the face to those who deny women of the liberty to choose. That alone is one thing to talk about which this film DEMANDS and I am soooo here for it. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Direk Tonet's range is a blessing to philippine cinema. The way her mind works, and every detail that was put into this film was nothing short of perfection. Hangang-hanga ako sa'yo, Direk, as in. BWELO!!! Also, this is Maris Racal's best performance yet, gets ba? The way it looked as if she really owned the pain, the way it REALLY felt as if everything was against her. Ang galing, sobra. Bwelo part 2!In terms of the film's themes, I just want to say na sobrang timely at perfect niya. EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE THIS. Abortion is healthcare, and to deny abortion means to disregard a person, more specifically, a woman's right to healthcare. Sana sa pamamagitan ng pagsusubaybay kung paano naging impyerno ang buhay ni Sunshine ng napakabilis, mamulat naman tayo kahit kakaunti. Speaking of women and healthcare, WE NEED MORE DOCTORS LIKE DOC HELENA!!!! Tangina imbyerna ako dun sa matandang biglang nag bible sharing, like of all places and of all situations, dun ka talaga?? Sa isang maternity ward?? Gets, Catholicism in the Philippines is widespread, pero that does not excuse the fact na there is a time and place for it jusko. Also, some might not get the little girl's (Annika Co) role sa film, pero the way I view it, She is the personification ng pinapasan nila. The inner saboteur that was born from immense societal pressure. The child they gave birth to, before actually giving birth. For me, sobrang important ng role niya dun, because Sunshine's body language can only tell so much, kaya they were a big help in terms of really navigating Sunshine's individuality. Then we have Miggy. Actually wala akong gustong sabihin sa kanya. Tangina niya. Let's leave it at that nalang. I have soooooo much to say about this film, but I'm going to leave it at that, because I want you and everyone else to watch it kasi sobrang relevant niya AS IN.

cloudyshina,10,"I really really wished i watched this at the cinema pero okay na rin ata na sa kwarto ko lang at mag-isa kong pinanuod ito dahil walang halong biro na iyak ko nang iyak, tsaka yung galit ko, walang mapagsidlan. Nakakagalit kasi sa tuwing napapag-usapan o napupunta sa ganitong topic iyong usapan, bakit kailangan pang ipaliwanag ang abortion nang maingat na para bang may matatapakan? Na sa tuwing pinipilit kong kumbinsihin sinumang kausap ko, palaging naiiyak ako sa sobrang frustration kasi di nila ma-gets iyong pinupunto ko. One time, habang naglalakad kami pa-Recto galing school, may baby na umiiyak sa sidewalk, may katabi siyang tulog na minor de edad na lalaki at babae (di ko alam kung kapatid ba ito nung baby o sila iyong parents). Then, there's also a time during a jeepney commute from Tondo to Quiapo, may nakasabay akong dalawang teenager rin na may dalang baby, one doing her best to hold the baby in her small arms while the other looked out for them. My concern goes out for the baby, but my greatest concern are for those kids, who were children as well. Madami pang beses na may na encounter ako na almost the same situation and even now, I could never know their real stories. At tuwing umuuwi ako sa bahay, isang malaking singhap at galit na naman sa gobyerno ang dala ko. Sabi nila, masyado akong sensitibo para maramdaman yung ganitong malalaking emosyon pero naisip ko, hindi nga ba dapat lang na magalit tayo? Hindi ba empathy ang pinakang kailangan sa mga ganitong pagkakataon at sitwasyon? Kaya gayon na lamang ang pasasalamat ko kay direk tonet sa paglikha ng karakter na kagaya ni Sunshine at pagsulat ng isang storya na totoong sumasalamin sa matagal nang suliranin ng mga kababaihan dito sa Pilipinas. Sobrang galing lamang na naipahayag nya iyong kwento nang may labis na pag-unawa, hindi lamang sa isang indibidwal, kundi sa maraming kababaihan na may parehas na kinatatayuan. Sobrang galing din ng cinematography, editing, at production design, lalo na nung napakinggan ko sa AWKP kung gaano ka meticulous iyong buong staff behind the camera para mai-portray ng pelikulang ito iyong mensahe na gusto nitong iparating. Sobrang galing at sobrang nakaka empower. Nawa'y maunawaan na nila, kung di man ng lahat pero sana ng nakararami lalong lalo na iyong may mga kapangyarihan (parehas sa gobyerno at religion) para maisaayos ang matagal nang kakulangan ng access sa maayos na healthcare dito sa bansa. You all preach for love and care for one another but when it's a girl or a woman just simply wanting ownership for her own body, you simply cannot give her that? Then, maybe your belief and love for God is too narrow-minded and shallow. It's high time we hear the pleas of all Sunshines out there! As for me, gets na gets kita Sunshine.

cinemarolio,10,"“Gets ko na.”The film doesn’t preach, it just lays out the messy truth. Sunshine chooses herself, her future, and her dreams, and the film refuses to guilt-trip her for it. It’s a story that sits right in the tension between “pro-life” in the traditional Filipino sense and the very real reality that a woman’s body is her call. My body, my choice. Hindi siya concept dito—pinapakita siya as lived experience.What makes the movie hit harder is how disruptive it is to the usual script. In our culture, teenage pregnancy is still treated like some moral test the girl has to pass, while the older generation automatically leans into religion, “pro-baby,” and quiet suffering as the noble path. Meanwhile, the guy who should be held accountable often disappears into the background, untouched. Or worse, the film doesn’t shy away from showing how men can also be the source of the violence—rape, exploitation, dynamics twisted by class and power.But the film doesn’t drown in despair. Sunshine’s sister? She’s the heartbeat of the whole thing. The support, the admiration, the way she stands beside Sunshine without making her feel small. And honestly, it’s the kind of love that exposes how warped the traditional expectations are. Some women support women. Some people actually understand that choosing yourself is choosing life.Sunshine isn’t a comfortable watch—and that’s the point. It shakes the old narratives, calls out the hypocrisy, and makes space for a girl to choose her own damn direction without being sanctified or demonized for it. Brave film.

leivfsl,10,"gets ko na.this film looks soft at first, but underneath it’s basically a reminder of how exhausting it actually is to be a woman in a world built by people who never had to fight for basic respect.it doesn’t go on some dramatic rant about misogyny. it just shows it—quiet, casual, constant. the kind of everyday sexism that everyone else seems numb to, the kind you’re expected to ignore unless it becomes too obvious to pretend it isn’t there. women always notice it long before anyone else does.being a woman now means moving through life with your guard halfway up all the time, because experience already taught you that someone is always ready to talk over you, question you, or blame you for something they’d excuse instantly if a man did it.that pressure—be perfect but not intimidating, kind but not “weak,” confident but not “too much”—it’s all over this film. not even in a dramatic way. just… there. like background noise we’ve gotten used to.what hit me the most is how the men in this movie move through the world with zero awareness. no fear. no second thoughts. they get space, leniency, the benefit of the doubt. women get judgment, expectations, consequences.and the crazy part is how normal it all feels. like yep, here we go again. this is just life.sunshine gets that quiet frustration—the tiredness that doesn’t go away. the way women are still somehow the ones expected to bend, adjust, shrink, compromise. the ones apologizing for having boundaries or opinions or basic self-respect.it’s not a movie that tries to “empower” or offer solutions. it doesn’t even try to soften the message. it just holds up a mirror and goes: “see? this is what we deal with.”and honestly… yeah. it is.",2025-11-26,1,0,watch,True

jstvwvk,10,"Sunshine is the kind of film that quietly earns for your attention. It pulls you into a world that feels overwhelmingly familiar yet rarely portrayed with this level of honesty. At the heart of it is Maris Racal, delivering what may be her most nuanced performance to date.The film’s backdrop, quiapo, is equally compelling. Masikip, Mainit, Maingay, Mabaho — pero buhay. This is a story of sacrifice, particularly the kind expected from women. That they are often asked to endure more than they should. They are expected to adjust, to stay, to carry, to choose responsibility over desire. Sunshine goes deeper, challenging the everyday hypocrisy we tend to overlook. This film will leave you with a question that lingers long after the credits fade: Do we truly have the right to decide what’s “right” for someone else?Sunshine reminds us that empathy begins where judgment ends. And at the core of all this realism and heaviness is a message that lands softly: choose kindness. because behind every decision is a story we do not fully know. behind every face is a storm we did not witness.Sunshine isn’t just the best filipino film i’ve watched this year — it is a brave, intimate, and necessary piece of storytelling.

bembie,10,"“Drown out the noise.” The words from her coach keep echoing in Sunshine’s mind whenever she loses focus during her routine. But in the middle of Manila—the blaring jeepney horns, the chaotic streets of Quiapo, the rumbling trains—there seems to be no escape from sound. Yet the real noise is inside her: voices in her head questioning, doubting, demanding answers. What is right? What should she choose? Should she continue pursuing the dream she started, or embrace the new life quietly growing inside her? Amid the chaos, Sunshine’s heart struggles, searching for peace, for direction, for the courage to decide.This is arguably one of the bravest Pinoy films released in Philippine cinema, even if it didn’t get wide distribution. It tackles women’s autonomy—raising a child, reproductive rights, and the right to choose what’s best for themselves. So bold, it challenges the comfort zone and questions the stereotypical mindset toward women who experience teenage pregnancy.The film is also a stark reminder of how broken our healthcare system is for women, especially in maternal care. Sunshine’s story is just the tip of the iceberg among thousands of women who struggle to keep their children alive or risk their bodies simply because their physiology or age cannot sustain a pregnancy.This is NOT about ABORTION. This film is about how women are crucified for past choices, how society lets one moment define a lifetime. It shows how young girls are often weaponized by circumstances beyond their control—pregnancy, abuse, or rape—without understanding that some are victims of forces they didn’t choose.“Gets ko na.” That line in the third act cemented this as one of the best films I’ve seen this year. It’s not just about understanding—it’s about Sunshine finally realizing what’s best for her. Her missteps never stopped her from becoming an Olympian.This film is powerful, necessary, and unforgettable. A definite must-watch.Lesson learned: Fuck men! hahaha",2025-11-26,0,0,watch,True
j4mie_,10,"Gets ko, sobra. As a woman in a country like the Ph, it is so hard to delineate where religion starts and where legislation begins for my rights. We see this movie consistently intertwine the illegality of abortion and the religious ramification of this practice to the point in which, one cannot exist without the other. In a country that prioritizes its religion, we forget how it can be weaponized to push inherently misogynistic notions that ultimately hold women back…",2025-11-26,1,0,watch,True

Likeeeee gets na gets kita, Sunshine, every fear, every decision, every moment. Maris Racal ATE! She carried this role so well. So many topics were handled here: teenage pregnancy, abortion, sexual abuse, the super bulok healthcare system ng Pinas, boi. This film is such an eye opener, and it hurts knowing so many women are actually living Sunshine’s reality. The movie was quiet… but it SLAAAPPSSS. HARD. Like, we need more films like this.

SOBRANG TAPANG MO SUNSHINE!!! ang hirap isipin kung gaano karaming sunshine ang kailangan danasin ang nakakasulasok na eskinita sa maynila. ilang libong babae pa ba ang magtitiis dahil wala silang ligtas, legal, at abot-kayang paraan para magdesisyon sa sarili nilang katawan? ang daming gustong tumingin, mangmata, manglait, mangutya, magsalita ng kung anu-ano pero wala ni isang piniling tumulong. para ito sa mga kababaihang danas ang kasuklam-suklam na pang-aabuso, at araw-araw na pakikibaka sa bansang ipinagdadamot ang ligtas at malayang pamumuhay. grabe yung tensyon na tinuhog sa pagitan ng relihiyon, kultura, at katawan. kasi kapag lumaki ka sa pilipinas, parang automatic na may mga boses sa utak mong magsasabing makasalanan ka bago ka pa man magdesisyon para sa sarili. NAKAKAGAGO DIBA. at maliban sa batas at polisiya, ang konsensyang binuo ng lipunan ang tunay na kulungan ng mga kababaihang gusto lang naman mamuhay at magdesisyon nang malaya.
