rashomiao,8,"i absolutely love how nuanced this is. how it took into consideration filipino contexts in discussing such a sensitive topic. i love the cinematography, absolutely stunning. captured the vibe of living in the busy and harmful streets of manila.discussed this with my gf but i find the heavy incorporation of religion in this quite integral to the story. while westerners may be able to discuss about abortion more openly, filipinos whose lives revolve around religion, are not at all the same. we were taught at an early age that religion is the absolute law, and we must follow every rule made in the name of religion. and so, the guilt sunshine carries throughout the film is heavier than ever, because not only was she dealing with the judgment of others, she was also dealing with the judgment of God, “The Father.” And, surprisingly enough, I find the presence of the child important. At first, she bothered me a bit, how she accused shine of being a murderer, stopped shine from her attempts at abortion. She’s the superego, the guilt that follows shine everywhere. But also, she’s a part of sunshine, hence her line “Pangarap ko ang pangarap niya.” (non verbatim) and so, she too, wishes to see sunshine succeed. Her running to sunshine after her final performance and saying “gets ko na” was her way of easing shine’s guilt. After all, as people love to give life to everyone’s unborn child, then I guess this once, I too, shall make use of that. Viewing sunshine’s life through the eyes of her “unborn child” must have been painful, yet every child I know has questioned (at least once) how good of a life their mother would’ve had, had they never been born. And just like every living child, the kid too, understood how much gymnastics meant to shine. And she was willing to trade the loss of her life for sunshine’s happiness, because she will always be a part of sunshine.",2025-12-07,0,0,watch,True

audioflicks,8,"Sunshine affected me deeply. The film explored women’s autonomy with so much honesty, and the characters’ struggles and victories felt incredibly real. I loved how it showed the layered challenges that come with unwanted pregnancies and the emotional, physical, and social weight women carry. The story treated its themes with grace and intelligence, and I truly believe it deserves a wide audience.One of the most powerful elements came from Sunshine’s relationship with her sister. Watching the difficulty of her sister’s life, especially the reality of raising a child, shaped her own decision. It felt like she saw her future in that picture, a future filled with sacrifices and dreams placed on hold. That glimpse alone said so much about choice, survival, and the pressure placed on women.The film also opened an entire landscape of conversations. Misogyny, women’s choices, abortion, body autonomy, laws, healthcare, and the quiet burdens carried by women in this country. These are everyday truths, yet they rarely reach the screen with this level of sincerity. I crave more stories with this courage, stories that explore mature themes with depth and curiosity. This film touched many important ideas and left me eager for even richer layers. Symbolism filled the entire narrative, and I loved how each detail carried emotional weight. I could spend an entire afternoon unpacking everything.One scene stays with me the most. The motel sequence. The stillness, the rumble of the train, her actions, and the aftermath created a breathtaking moment. That scene captured the danger of doing something unfamiliar to one’s body and the immense pressure created by law and religion. It felt intense, raw, and beautifully crafted.And the presence of the kid as her guilty conscience completed the emotional arc in such a striking way. It felt like a final haunting reminder of everything she carried.",2025-12-06,0,0,watch,False

louiese,8,"this is a film that shows several harsh realities that many young women face every day. it tackles sensitive yet crucial issues such as unplanned pregnancy, illegal abortion, sexual assault committed by a family member, the heavy influence of religion on decision-making, and how one snap can completely shatter a young person’s future. these themes are not exaggerated; they are painful and real. “Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas.”the film drop a reality line about women especially here in the philippines. this resonates the lived experiences of countless young women who grew up navigating a society that often blames them first before offering help.the movie also embodied the noises—the noise of judgment from society, the noise of broken dreams, and the noise coming from people who desperately need help but have nowhere to turn. it speaks out that the loudest sound isn’t the chaos of Manila’s streets, but the silent cries of countless helpless women. the film exposes the flaws in our cultural, social, and institutional systems, making it easy to see where we are lacking the most.the scene showing the overcrowded OB department in a public hospital was somehow alarming. it’s chaotic, understaffed, and overcrowded—yet this reflects reality. it reveals how instead of creating long-term solutions, government tend to simply acknowledge the issue or, worse, disregard it. the systems remain weak and unresponsive.beyond all of these social issues, the film also shows how dreams can easily collapse under the weight of societal pressure. this makes the film more than just a film—it becomes a moviefied reflection of the everyday struggles of filipino youth, especially young women who are forced to grow up too fast.overall, the movie sunshine is a wake-up call. it’s a call for empathy, understanding, and meaningful change.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

augustisaugust,10,"Hindi ako magaling sa pag kritiko ng mga bagay-bagay, lalo na sa mga pelikula. Pero sinusubukan ko. Ang pelikulang ""Sunshine"" idinirekta ni Antoinette Jadaone sobrang danas at isyu sa bansang Pilipinas. Ang ganda ng set sa manila, ang raw, rinig at ramdam mo ang init, sikip, usok, baho, at gulo. Noong tatapatin pa lang niya yung nakabuntis sa kanya itong salita agad ang pumasok sa isip kong sasabihin ng lalaki e,""Sigurado ka bang sa akin 'yan?"" Ito talaga ang una mong maririnig sa isang lalaki kapag sinabi ng isang babae na ""buntis ako"". Walang hiyang linya 'yan imbes na pagsuporta kay Sunshine pagdududa ang ibibigay para ikaila yung responsibilidad, lalaki nga. hahahahaha, sorry kung may pagka discriminate sa parteng ito pero iyan ang reyalidad. Sunod naman yung batang si Anika, noong una hindi ko gets bakit bigla siyang susulpot at mawawala. Para sa akin para siyang inner child ni Sunshine kung susuriin yung pelikula sa bandang dulo nang tinuloy ni Sunshine na gamitin yung nabiling gamot sa Ale sa quiapo, basta fast-forward sa tricycle, makikita na yung legs ni Anika ay may dugo rin which is sign na ganon ang epekto ng nabili niyang gamot o pag abort, hindi ko ma explain pero gets na yan, at kung paano huminga si Sunshine ganoon din siya noong isinusugod na siya sa hospital. Tapos parang noong una hindi pa gets ni Anika yung mga desisyon ni Sunshine sa kagustuhang magpa abort pero yung sa huli nakita niya kung paano mahal at gusto ni Sunshine yung pangrap niya kaya I love the part na sinabi niya na ""gets ko na"" ika niya nga. Tapos if you think yung pagintindi ay hindi nanggaling sa iba kundi sa sarili niya diba????? So, ito na nga dahil binanggit ko na ang quiapo, gusto ko rin yung scene na matapos niyang malaman na buntis siya dumiretso agad siya sa simbahan para mag dasal. why? kasi may guilt siya part niya sana gets niyo ako, staka super religious o predominant catholic itong bansa natin, sana gets hahahaha...tapos diba yung binilhan ni Sunshine ng pangpa abort parang katabi o malapit sa simbahan parang na pinipilit ng relihiyon at batas ang mga babae sa isang krisis, ngunit ang parehong lugar din ang kanilang takbuhan para maghanap ng bawal na solusyon. Sobrang konserbatibong bansa. At sunod ulit yung pag bili niya ng illegal na pangpa abort, no choice e, walang health care sa mga katulad niyang may ganoong problem. diba? ang lala ng sistema, walang program na pwedeng lapitan right away. Kasi ano ang unang nangyayari o ginagawa ng mga tao pag ang isang babae ay buntis, ang gagawin ng ibang tao manghusga ngunit hindi naman handang magbigay ng practical na tulong. Kaya ang katuwang lang ng babae ay sino? Sarili, dignidad, at pangrap. Kaya, gets ko si Sunshine sa mga desisyon niya, it's a relief for her kung gagawin niya yung illegal. At huli, sobrang galing ni Maris Racal, hanga ako, dalang-dala niya talaga yung bigat ng karakter. Mata-mata acting at yung pag perform niya galing. Huli na talaga, gustong-gusto ko ang mura ng batang si Anika, galing! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",2025-12-07,0,0,watch,True

I love it when movies really present a story that challenges their audience to think about and start a conversation for. It is so enticing and deeply original in a way that it tried to tackle a story that is morally frowned upon in the Philippines so having a brave set of creative to present is just impressive. The performances of the entire cast is truly memorable and that scene from Maris and Jennica will be an important one that would heal so many hearts.

Banyak hal dibiarkan ambigu, tapi justru itu yang bikin interpretasinya hidup. Kita diajak ngikutin proses dia ngambil kembali kendali atas tubuh dan masa depannya, pelan-pelan, tanpa drama berlebihan. Aku merasa ada satu titik di mana semuanya terasa klik. Bukan karena dijelasin, tapi karena apa ya bisa pahamlah gitu dari caranya bersikap dan bertindak.Akhirnya juga bukan yang gimana-gimana, tapi ya kerasa personal dan melegakan.

Giving agency to the people whose decisions will only affect them anyway sounds so simple since you can apply it to almost anything, but once abortion is mentioned, suddenly some people want to control the decisions of other people.Religion is obviously at the forefront of this topic. People forget that their religion is based on faith, not objective truth.

For Sunshine, the act of making a decision carries extraordinary weight, as she becomes fully aware of the consequences that she will have to faceI appreciate that the filmmakers not only showed how Sunshine arrived at her decision, but also place emphasis on why she makes it. The narrative thoughtfully explores the influences, pressures, and circumstances that frame her choices, allowing the audience to understand her on a deeper level.The film effectively captures the bleak realities and unfiltered rawness of Manila, which it is easy for me to say “gets ko na”—to agree with certain moments and empathize with Sunshine’s actions, precisely because the film enables us to feel the gravity of her experiences.This work is a feat for Filipino cinema.

So miggy, pakyu.Pero grabe, you can feel the internal battle Sunshine was going through and I think that every single woman who has a dream, a goal in life perhaps, if situated the same, would go through the same lengths. Maybe not through all of that extent, but this is such an eye opening movie to those who still feel like abortion in the philippines is taboo.

Ang ironic lang for me na kalat sa labas ng Quiapo ang bentahan ng mga gamot pampalaglag, habang ang sistema natin ay patuloy na tutol sa ganitong paraan. Goosebumps when my friends and I noticed the sign sa jeep saying “Gift of God”, we came up with only one assumption of what that sign is trying to tell the viewers. Simply, babies are a blessing. And that’s what they’ll always say whenever abortion comes up in a conversation.The symbolism of the Kid who has been following Sunshine all throughout the film. My first assumption was— she was the conscience of the latter. Obviously, lumalabas siya every time na may gagawin si Sunshine sa pagbubuntis niya. Siya ang constant reminder na lahat nang gagawin niya ay mali. Second, it was Sunshine’s younger version. Trying to tell her something. Pero bandang dulo ng film it was revealed na it was the baby. I would like to believe na malaki ang naging parte niya sa naging desisyon ni Sunshine. Because Sunshine was the happiest when she’s doing what she love. Walang karapatan ang kahit sino man sa magiging desisyon ng babae para sa katawan niya.Super dami kong pang gustong sabihin sa film na ‘to kasi super pleased ako sa mga details and symbolisms.

champagnebelley,9,"i have so many thoughts about this movie so i might just make edits. also i only got to watch it now kasi kakarelease lang sa netflix first i just wanted to applaud the use of background noises. i think im so used to movies relying on ‘noise cancellation’ that the background sounds were so instantly noticeable for me, and i understood it as something integral to the plot na ‘sunshine’s story is just one sound among many’, and thinking about how noisy these public spaces are (quiapo, avenida) parang ang liit tignan ng buhay ni sunshine tuloy. and it’s so real that society tends to overlook the lives of these women where they’re commonly diminished into statistics or cautionary talesi can even argue that in some instances, like sunshine praying outside the quiapo church or secretly talking to the pamparegla seller, is a ‘background noise’ in itself. naingayan ako sa mga scenes na yun to the point where the dialogue was just blending with the background noise. it really says a lot about how these stories are just among us, and it’s so devastating to think that something as serious as this matter (something hindering of one’s ambitions and with the capacity of changing the direction of one’s life) blends so well with noise we consider every-day and mundanesecond, this movie really touched my pathos 🤓 given my positionality as a woman. the scrolling on reddit, silently looking for online communities or help..ugh i understood the frustration of being a woman in a catholic country so well. i obviously have never been pregnant, but when im at the BIOLOGICAL age for it, ang scary to think na we don’t have that option at all, na our bodily autonomies are immediately disregarded by others just because of personal beliefs. ang daming instances when i was watching na iniisip ko nalang ‘what if that were me?’ SYEMPRE WAG NAMAN SANA PERO that’s the point diba? for the movie to put us in the shoes of sunshine and make us FEEL that we don’t want to be in her shoes. that way we’ll think of challenging the system that we currently have but i really love how despite the circumstances, sunshine was still adamant about being true to her autonomy and GANUN talaga dapat. i heard the ending was supposed to be different, but im so glad they changed it to this",2025-12-06,0,0,watch,False

It tries to do too much for its own good. The sequence of events make no sense, relationships with people have no emotional weight aside from Sunshine and her sister, ang gulo.

""Sunshine"" is a film that goes beyond entertainment; it also functions as an eye-opener. I hope na mas marami pa ang manood ng movie na ‘to. Para ma-realize nila kung gaano kahalaga na i-legalize ang aborsyon sa bansa. Kasi, sa totoo lang, napakaraming problema na puwedeng ma-solve kapag na-legalize na ang aborsyon (e.g., poverty, suicide cases, unemployment, uneducated people, etc.).Ang solid talaga nito, pati ‘yung mga bwisit na chismosa at religious people na nagpapaka-saint kuhang-kuha. But joke aside, nakakainis talaga ‘yung mga nagmamagaling na ‘yan, ta’s gagamitin pa ang Bible para i-justify ang pagiging ignorante nila. Like please, can’t they learn to set aside their religious beliefs and think about what truly matters?! They disagree, solely because the bible says it’s a sin. But what about those who have (and will) suffer? All they care about is that the baby gets delivered, but what comes after that? They don’t care. They really know how to be a pain in the ass.",2025-12-06,1,0,watch,True

Anyways, the movie did great in relying why sometimes some reasons do weigh more in terms of accepting an unwanted child birth, but well I do not actively support it but I respect it. I am not to judge to what they do, because sometimes when you think about it, like for instance that 13 girl who was raped by her mother's boyfriend(What an absolute ahole btw and also the mother??? which brings me that some women is not fit to be a mother. So if you do not want a child please don't be stupid and use protection like always.) is such a nightmare and to think that girl probably do not fully grasp the whole situation she is in, I understand why she also did what she did. Also to end this, if abortion is not allowed, why is contraceptive allowed? Like isn't like almost the same? You are not giving the reproductive cells do well some reproduction. The only difference is that abortion is the baby is already alive but the reproductive cells is prevented to be much more(a new life).",2025-12-05,0,0,watch,False

I think what I found so strikingly sad about this is that, fourteen years removed from the Philippines (more than half of my life!); I try to tread carefully when I talk about Manila, the people and their struggles. I don't think that my incredibly sheltered memory of the place would hold as much cultural weight than that of a local, and yet fourteen years later Manila is still...Manila. And if I am brought to tears by this, I wonder about the grief carried by generations of young women failed by a dated system. In all her films, what Jadaone ultimately wants, or rather demands for her female protagonists, is Space. Space to exist safely and choose freely.To break women out of crowded public maternity wards with shared beds, obsolete facilities, abject doctors (with their religious biases), and to bring them into the clearing of their dreams, the main-stage gymnasium, the Olympics.",2025-12-05,0,0,watch,True

maudlines,8,"“Ayoko maging nanay. Hindi ko ipapanganak ‘to dahil hindi ako ready maging nanay.” / English: I don’t want to be a mother. I won’t give birth to this child because I’m not ready to become a mother.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines, heck even being pro-choice here is looked down upon. Yet, motherhood is an expected life trajectory for many Filipino women, that is if you marry at the “right age” and have more than 1 child at the “right time”. So what choice do women have if they are pregnant under different circumstances? For a country that claims to be collectivist (pakikipagkapwa tao mindset ang dapat pinapairal, etc.), how can this principle become a universal behavior for most when its own government continues to throw its own citizens under the bus? Every dire problem that needs to be addressed can be traced back to how fucked Filipinos are by their government. Whatever rhetoric the Spaniards spread about Filipinos being “lazy” is still used today by the rich and powerful, their basis why the Philippines continues to be poor. Galit na galit ako sa nagtitinda ng mga pekeng “gamot” para sa pagpapalaglag ng bata, the review she showed Sunshine that it was effective could possibly be fake, pero narealize ko na nagbebenta sila ng pekeng solusyon para sa maka ahon sa buhay (not justification of this behavior). This government continues to fail people in every aspect of life, you’d realize why the crime is so high. But is it such a crime to not want a baby? (It is not).How can Filipinos truly care for the children (whether born or unborn) when elected officials undermine reproductive health in this country, primarily women’s health. The Reproductive Health Law faced a long legislative battle just to get passed, and it still took two years for the law to be fully accessible for the public. When your prospects are so thin, people will do anything to get what they want, even if it costs their life. That is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of Filipinos.

arthouzhi,10,"Sunshine (2024) looks soft, warm, almost gentle on the surface. the colors cradle you, the scenes feel tender, and at first, you think it is comforting. but beneath all of that warmth carries a weight that is impossible to ignore. it is about abortion in the Philippines, where it is illegal, and labeled as “blasphemous,” “disgraceful,” and judged above the lives it affects. the film does not shy away from showing how cruel reality can be. people, even doctors, prioritize morality over humanity, ignoring the pain, the fear, and the uncertainty of the woman at the center. it shows a woman whose future and potential clash with society’s judgment.the unknown girl who follows Sunshine feels like a younger version of herself. she is the part of Sunshine that believes abortion is wrong, the part that cannot yet grasp the weight of a life lived on someone else’s terms. and yet, by the end, she mutters, “gets ko na.” she sees that Sunshine’s life is not a simple question of right and wrong. she feels the burden Sunshine carries, the life she cannot give without losing herself. she recognizes how much was left for Sunshine to live, how much potential to burn bright, and how pregnancy would have dimmed it. she senses the life that should have belonged to Sunshine alone.the realization does not absolve, it recognizes the choices forced upon someone who should have been free to live her life on her own terms. that recognition shatters you more than any argument, any moral lesson ever could.watching this film, you feel everything at once. the warmth of the colors, the softness of the scenes, the love in small gestures, and then the ache, the rage, the grief that lingers because the world can be cruel, unfair, unfeeling. Sunshine is about life that is too heavy for the judgment of others. it is about the potential snuffed out when morality is chosen over empathy. it is about understanding, even when the world cannot. it is gentle, devastating, and necessary. it will stay with you long after the credits roll.Sunshine is soft to watch, hard to forget, and brutally honest about the ways society fails those who need understanding the most.it will make you feel what it is to live, to choose, to survive, and to understand when understanding is all that remains.",2025-12-05,0,0,watch,True

zbloodhail,9,"“kasalanan sa mata ng diyos”is abortion a sin? people will answer this differently because morality in the philippines is rarely personal. it is inherited by religion, tradition, and the weight of everyone watching. for many, the word “abortion” automatically activates the label of sin, as if life were a simple moral equation and suffering didn’t count as part of the formula. for others, it is a decision carved out of fear, pressure, and survival, made in the middle of circumstances that no outsider fully understands. kung ginahasa ka, kasalanan pa rin ba ang pagpapalaglag sa bata? if your answer is yes, then your moral compass is calibrated more by dogma than empathy, and your worldview is as rigid as the doctrine you inherited without questioning.conservatism in the philippines is not subtle. it is soaked into daily life, in families, in pulpits, reinforced by laws that pretend neutrality but are shaped by centuries of religious influence. sa bansa natin, halos lahat ng desisyon ng babae ay may kasamang mata ng lipunan na handang humusga, tama? abortion becomes more than a medical choice; it becomes a cultural crime, a symbol that people weaponize even when they know nothing about the life behind the decision. the environment itself—manila’s density, poverty, inequality, survivalism—creates conditions where choices are never purely “moral.” what do you expect from a city where half the population is just trying to get through the day?when you strip away the labels, the question of sin becomes less religious and more philosophical. sin implies intent, malice, or moral wrongdoing. abortion, for many, is none of these. if you’d ask me i’d say that, it is not an act of cruelty. it is a response to reality, a calculated survival decision shaped by pressure that most people never experience. kung hindi mo kailanman naramdaman ang desperasyon ng isang taong walang mapuntahan, anong karapatan mong magsabing mali ang pinili niya? reducing abortion to “sin” ignores everything: economic instability, trauma, lack of support systems, inaccessible healthcare, fear of judgment, and the sheer brutality of living in a country that demands endurance but offers nothing in return.the real discussion is not about moral purity but about environment. what context shaped the choice? what access to resources existed? what physical, emotional, and social risks will the woman face? people prefer judgment over understanding because judgment feels easier. introspection requires effort, and compassion requires complexity—two things society often avoids.if morality is measured by harm done, abortion may not be a sin at all. it may be a reflection of a society that fails its people so deeply that they must make decisions the world refuses to understand. sa totoo lang, mas madali para sa lipunan na manisi kaysa kumilala ng sistematikong pagkukulang. we condemn individuals because it distracts us from confronting the bigger failure—the environment that gave them no safe path.the real sin might not be in the act of abortion but in the society that makes someone carry the weight alone. a society that romanticizes suffering, worships conformity, and punishes anyone who chooses survival over tradition. a society that has the audacity to moralize while refusing to provide support, empathy, or alternatives.",2025-12-05,4,0,watch,True

The emotional turmoil that sends her into a downward spiral ghastly encapsulates the prevalent issue of teenage and accidental pregnancies in the Philippines and how public's notions that are grounded from bigotry, conservatism, and outdated values can negatively imbue the minds of these helpless women.The fragments of Sunshine's psyche of children also deepened the already thematically layered piece where it now provides the protagonist a whole new outlook whether she should carry on with the pregnancy or terminate it. What I really love about it is the film stays grounded to its footing and steadily focuses on putting the audience in Sunshine's lens. The last act with the kid is a top-notch and probably the most heartwarming scene in the whole film.Maris Racal's impeccable performance also puts the cherry on top where the in-depth introspect of a young woman that is going down the rabbit hole won't be solidified without her.

And to my mom who had dreams too, until she found out she was pregnant with me, she was torn a real 50/50 on whether to keep me or not. She chose to keep me and eventually married my dad.Sometimes I can’t help wondering what her life could’ve been if she pursued her own dreams.

At bilang bansa na predominantly Catholic (sigh), alam mo na agad na taboo ’to. Ang hirap maging pro-choice sa isang lugar na agad kang hinuhusgahan bago ka pa marinig.Kaya huge deal talaga na may pelikulang gaya nito na nag-oopen ng usapan. At pinaka-tumatatak sa akin ’yung paalala na ang babae… tao. Hindi lang “may dinadala.” Hindi lang vessel. Tao.Na may nararamdaman, may konsensya.Na may sariling isip at puso.Na may takot at pangarap.At hindi biro ’yung bigat ng bawat desisyong kailangan niyang pasanin mag-isa.Tapos Manila as the backdrop???

melthing,8,"Sunshine is a feat for Philippine cinema. It tackles a topic most are scared to produce and it was written WELL. Yes, without the poverty porn or political porn most films of ours subtexts. There are characters that are REAL. Not written to tell unjustly-unrelated issues but to support the story itself. And so, characters that are in poverty aren’t written to convey another message, rather to stand with what the film is about in the first place. This film is easily the one of the best written films of all time in our history. Not only does it tell a beautiful picture of a character undergoing such a life-turning “accident” but how it tells it psychologically, and powerfully. It never let go of what it portrays nor does it settle for a scene that would bring in viewers, it’s written SO realistically that you’d forget it’s a movie. A quick one to point out is Sunshine texting her bestfriend, at the time she needs support the most, even if she’s disappointed for losing contact with her, she still texts out of fear, and that’s something i’m sure plenty of people have done. Those text messages are so real, raw and incredibly well-written too. The whole story is an absolute masterclass of writing a film straightforwardly without losing the essence of what it is. It’s a display of perfect world-building, from the story of her boyfriend, the realistic response from him to the story of the tindera, who without building a relationship, completely makes sense of the film. Even built a subtext of a no nonsense coach that adds to fear, support, motive and regret of the main character.I can tell you all about the beautiful writing but this would be too long. Let’s get to the cinematography. Well, it’s good. Definitely better than most films, it’s quite obvious that certain camera works and shots aren’t just to finish the scene but is chosen to look good while portraying a scene nicely. There’s a lot of cues that whispers visually, like how she prays with bars infront of her, evoking the feeling of our character not FEELING or BEING welcome inside the church. Shot-selections like those sre essential and quite reliable to make a scene impactful so i’m incredibly proud they excerted better effort to make this film the best it could possibly be. Wouldn’t say it’s a strong suit, but this fil is definitely visually well-made.I’ve always seen Maris Racal as a great actress before this, now she’s PHENOMENAL one and is one of the best in the industry right now. The talent to portray talent and skill alone, is something most actors/actresses not only have the chance to audition for BUT absolutely nails from the first to the last second of the film. There’s a Piolo Pascual jumpscare here, Elijah Canlas KILLS it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.Sunshine is great, it’s amazingly told through emotions and a bit of a psychologically present engagement to allow interpretations of viewers be as wide as it can.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

Because abortion is not accessible in this country, women tend to rely on unsafe methods that could harm their bodies or, worse, could kill them. Other people shouldn’t have an opinion on what women choose to do with their bodies.

Pero they ignore what's happening around the world. They ignore that there's a genocide happening in Sudan and in Gaza. Wala silang pake. Tapos when it comes to women's reproductive health, hala gustong mangialam. Bida bida ka teh? Stupid laws! Yes im pertaining to divorce and abortion.You care so much about life pero wala kang pake even if it endangers the life of the mother. You care so much about the sanctity of marriage yet you turn a blind eye when there are millions of women being abused.Ang kapal mo naman.Catholic daw kasi.Duh, Catholic country din ang Spain pero they separated criminal law. Tapos yung ayaw pang mag pasa ng abortion bill is yung may mga case pa against humanity, haha kalokohan.Those law dont protect anyone.Anti-abortion law cannot make the woman love the child lalo na if that child is the everyday reminder of what hell she went through. Kawawa parehas diba? The kid's unloved, tapos reminder pa ng pang aabuso sa nanay niya. Anti-divorce law can't make a broken family happy again. It not just damage the parents, but also the kids.

So mas okay na nakikita ng mga anak nila na nagsisigawan sila, na nag sasakitan at ginagawang punching bag yung nanay nila kaysa maghiwalay?!Keeping these bans doesn’t uphold morality, it endangers women, silences survivors, and empowers abusers.You're not protecting anyone but the perpetrators.And I hope this film serves as a message.",2025-12-04,1,0,watch,False

aijikken,10,"Sunshine is one of those rare Filipino films that refuses to look away. Instead of sugarcoating or romanticizing the world its characters inhabit, it confronts the audience with the uncomfortable truths we collectively sidestep—the toxic mindsets we inherit, the social issues we normalize, and the moral rigidity we mistake for virtue.What makes the film remarkable is its honesty. It acknowledges how deeply ingrained complacency is in our culture, how we often witness injustice, misogyny, or dysfunction and simply shrug, labeling it as “ganun talaga.” Sunshine exposes that mentality for what it is: a quiet violence that enables suffering. The film does not preach; it simply presents the weight of these realities with clarity and emotional intelligence, letting the audience feel the consequences of silence and inaction.Its commentary on anti-abortion attitudes is especially bold for Philippine cinema. Rather than reducing the debate to dogma or melodrama, the film shows how anti-abortion rhetoric becomes a peril for women; not just physically, but emotionally, socially, and economically. It reveals how denying reproductive autonomy restricts their futures, limits their ambitions, and punishes them for choices men are rarely held accountable for. Sunshine portrays this with nuance: the internal conflict, the fear of judgment, the systemic lack of support, and the complete absence of safe options. The film understands that this isn’t just a “moral issue”—it’s a structural one, tied to poverty, misogyny, and societal expectations about what women owe to the world.Ultimately, Sunshine is more than a movie; it’s a critique of the culture that raised us. It forces us to ask why we maintain harmful traditions, why morality is weaponized against women, and why we accept inequality as a norm. Its power lies in its refusal to let the audience remain comfortable, and in reminding us that the first step toward progress is learning to confront what we’ve been taught to ignore.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

Ang tapang ng pelikulang ‘to, not just in the execution, but sa choice of subject matter. Makamasa, madaling kapitan, and at the same time, a real eye-opener. From start to finish, ramdam mo yung puso at bigat ng kuwento, and yet ang linis ng pagkakadala.Maris Racal shines in a way that’s both raw and controlled; she gives a performance that stays with you long after the credits roll. Jennica Garcia is equally powerful, grabe yung presence niya, every scene hits (we all need a family member like her!!). Together, they carry the emotional core of the film so well na hindi mo mapigilang maapektuhan like ALL I CAN SAY IS I REALLY LOVE WOMEN SM.But above all, very important yung conversation na binubuksan ng Sunshine. Abortion is a difficult, nuanced topic—one that should be openly discussed not just within families, but within our society and government. And I firmly believe na choosing yourself first, your success, your safety, your future matters just as much. AND, women should be able to decide for themselves: their body, their rules. This isn't a simple issue, and the film treats it with the depth and humanity it deserves.Sunshine is indeed a courageous and a necessary film that everyone should watch!!",2025-12-04,1,0,watch,True

davoarid,7,"More didactic than her previous films, but this is still a great “social issues” drama (albeit one with some magical realist touches), with a moving central performance. In terms of “abortion movies,” it really does a great job of making its case. For a teenage gymnast, carrying a baby to term really does completely remove that path as a possibility for her life—that dream just gets immediately destroyed, in a way that (obviously) won’t happen for the baby’s father, and it’s why it’s so essential to this film’s success that Jadaone so skillfully captures the tactile and practical *reality* of Sunshine’s body in the gymnastic scenes: that body, with its graceful and athletic movements, that she has spent her entire life molding for this sole purpose of Olympic gold, and it will go away, permanently, if she doesn’t have an abortion. I also think Jadaone does a good job of avoiding deck-stacking. Yes, the pro-life nurse who castigates Sunshine is portrayed as a witch, but the saleswoman who gives her the abortifacients is also shown to be a greedy haggler herself. And while the two male figures pressuring her to have the baby (her boyfriend and her boyfriend’s father) both make specious and insincere cases, it is again to Jadaone’s credit that she cast two dynamic male performers for these roles (Elijah Canlas and Pio Pascual—whom I didn’t recognize in a straight-up “Dad” role, after decades playing the heart-throb!)…this is one of those reviews where in the process of writing it I’ve realized I liked the movie a lot more than I thought I did while the credits were rolling.

raven_hoodie,8,"One of the biggest factors holding back the Philippines from being as progressive as our neighboring countries like China and Japan is our deep entanglement with religion—Christianity, in particular. As much as faith shapes our culture, it also becomes a hindrance to national progress when religious beliefs are imposed on matters that should prioritize the welfare and rights of all citizens. Imagine how much better our society could be if we allowed personal freedoms and evidence-based policies to guide our decisions, instead of insisting on religious doctrine as the standard for everyone.The movie portrayed this reality so powerfully. It addressed so many issues in one narrative—how women are often the ones who suffer the most under a misogynistic system, how men can easily walk away from responsibilities while women cannot, and how horrifying it is that young girls, even minors, can be raped and then forced to bear a child. These are the consequences of a society that refuses to give women full autonomy over their own bodies.I truly hope more people come to realize the importance of allowing women to make decisions for themselves by legalizing abortion. Every woman deserves the right to choose what happens to her own body.Despite the heaviness of the story, I’m glad that Sunshine still managed to pursue the dream she longed for, proving that resilience can still bloom even in the harshest circumstances.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

jazsisante7,7,"I may be on the unpopular side of this: I want to love this so badly but for some reason, I can't help to mull-on & pinpoint some details lacked for me and thought it needed more revising story-wise. I am not hating on this. In fact, I actually like several parts of the movie. I think it's fair to say (and undeniably so) that this is an important and a refreshing story on what's the take of abortion & body autonomy here in the Philippines and I do appreciate this movie for that. (I added the half star plus because it still is an important movie)I want to love this movie (but only like it) because I thought it obviously have such a great potential to be ""a great movie"" on most aspects. What holds me back is the writing, story-wise.It started really strong and direct to the point which I really liked. By the next part, we'd see a little girl who follows Sunshine. At first it seems to me that it could be her inner child or her unborn future child so it confused me a bit (most especially on the part where Sunshine was rushed to the hospital, we'd see a blood on her crotch area as well). This device they used provided a bit of comic relief in the movie which I thought is cute and actually can be an effective way to delve deeper sentimentally because its so personal. However, I came to learn (through online reading) that she is indeed her unborn future child (bc of Ariana disappearing). To be honest, I couldn't finalize my thoughts on this whether I like it or not because with that in mind, the mix message does confuse some a bit on whether or not it's a ""pro-life"" but I guess that could also be the point that it is complicated. Afterall, Sunshine did kept coming back to the church scenes and this can represent a lot of women who faces/d the same situation. I just thought the movie might have to clarify in telling that message.I also much prefer her being Sunshine's inner child (which could be a ""tangible"" reminder on what the whole movie is all about, Sunshine taking control of her own life and the dream of being a national athlete ever since she's a child). But the line ""Gets ko na"" have such a great impact on people because of its ""casualness"" but its the words that has a really heavy weight on it that I thought is effective to pull people's heartstrings in. Another aspect of the movie that kinda lacked for me which is, I think a big part of it: I want to see how much Sunshine wants it by seeing her own training to be a gymnast. What does she do every day as a training athlete? How does she balance everything in her life-- being a sister/aunt/student/friend/a woman in general while also being a training athlete? What do you to do train as a gymnast? How heavy does it weigh on her that she's truly doing every thing she can to be in olympics and be a great gymnast, what does it look like? I wished she saw that a bit (even just in a montage) before or during the moment she found out she got pregnant. I want to see her really work hard and see how much blood, sweat, and tears and really feel and see that ""goddamn it i want this so bad"" and not just tell it. I guess what I want to say is that I want more training scenes too because I am also interested in watching gymnasts do their thing haha.I also thought that by the 3/4 part of the movie where we do meet Ariana is kinda took a different turn for the movie. I am not sure if it is necessary that we meet another kid (Ariana, not Mary Grace) and that maybe without that, they could still end up getting the same storyline/result (though don't get me wrong, I did like Ariana, i think she's fab). It also didn't do much impact on Sunshine's decision but rather it does prove how fucked up it is that this happen in reality and how shitty it is again that we don't have much (legal and safe, known) access to women's sexual and reproductive health services, let alone being a woman/person who's forced into something they aren't ready to be/never wanted be in the first place.More so, the visuals and cinematography, can't deny that it is beautiful, that's a given. Acting is amazing, no notes no doubt.A little predictable on emphasizing on the Manila landscape and scenery although it is still beautiful to look at (especially considering to people haven't been to Manila/Philippines, at least they'd get the gist of it even though its not all picturesque all the time). I especially appreciate the movie getting in deep and showing the grim & messy ways of taking different methods of abortion. I thought its very important to see how harrowing and fucking hard/harsh/unfair/dangerous it is that women have to/had no choice to do experiences like these. I only wished that they showed the method of when Sunshine made an appointment for that Doctor Helena because maybe it could also show that abortion could also have safe and harmless way that would make people feel less wary and scared of it and maybe even talk about it.With all that, in conclusion I think I do like this movie. It is an important movie to exists especially at our modern times, it's long overdue that we finally talk about this here in our country. I hope we keep talking about it because it is necessary for us we want to keep fighting for women's rights. I don't love it but I do like it and I appreciate it for what it did.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

slimedeni,10,"this is what the filipino people need to see more often. it might be obscure for some, but it is timely and important. teenage mothers are often judged for carrying a child; whether they keep it or not, judgement will still eye on them. the guilt of their conscience will still haunt and hunt them. but we never get to see their point of view, we only see them for the mistakes they have done. where is that energy when it comes to boys who choose to abandon the outcome of their bad decisions? nowhere. i love how this film doesn’t just show us the story of a teenage girl who got pregnant while chasing her dreams—it is a story of all the girls and women who are forced to carry a baggage they never asked for. we saw their hardships and struggles. it also shows us how flawed our system is and how hypocritical some religious people are. this should be a wake up call. the little girl (annika) doesn’t just represent sunshine’s unborn child—she also represents us. we only see abortion and choosing oneself as something wrong and sinful because we are too blinded by what was merely taught to us. we never get to see or feel what others feel. and once we do, we will understand them. that is when we will realize. let’s be more like the little girl, let’s try to understand more.i also love that they chose manila as the setting of this film. it might not be important but i think it is. manila is messy, scary, and it will kill you. but once you overcome it, you’ll see its beauty.lastly, sorry pero super bothered talaga ko sa part na nasa lope de vega na sila tapos ang layo pa ng hospital na pinuntahan nila e mas malapit naman ang metro, san lazaro, or jose reyes. 😞🙏🏼 bothered lang ako pero gets ko naman kung bakit, so wala na lang yon, di siya mahalaga. hahaha",2025-12-03,1,0,watch,True
reeladvicenet,8,"Source: www.reeladvice.net/2025/12/sunshine-2024-movie-review.htmlAntoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine has been one of our most anticipated local releases of the year and it does not disappoint. Emotionally charged and socially resonant, the film tackles teen pregnancy and the realities of limited reproductive rights in the Philippines with honesty and empathy. While it may not offer clear-cut moral answers, Sunshine succeeds in revealing the real and painful stakes of becoming a young mother tackling equally both sides of the moral coin.National gymnast Sunshine (Maris Racal) has always dreamed of competing in the Olympics. With qualifiers fast approaching, she pushes her body to its limits until she suddenly faints during training. What she assumes is exhaustion from her intense regimen and strict diet turns out to be something far more life-altering: she is pregnant. At only 19 and with her lifelong dream on the line, Sunshine faces a bitter decision: keep the child and lose her final chance at the Olympics, or pursue an illegal abortion and grapple with the moral and emotional fallout.As expected, Sunshine doesn’t shy away from tough conversations. Its central dilemma is painfully relatable, regardless of where you stand on the right to choose in a predominantly Catholic country. Maris Racal is a revelation, delivering a nuanced and deeply human performance as a young athlete forced to confront consequences that will shape the rest of her life. And while we won’t spoil where the story ultimately lands, the film takes a definitive stance without betraying the complexity of its subject matter. It was a balancing act handled with notable care.What elevates Sunshine further is how vividly it captures the societal pressures and chaotic realities of Philippine society when it comes to the right to choose. The judgment, the ironies, the lack of support systems, everything feels painfully authentic and grounded. Where the film stumbles slightly is in its more fantastical elements. Though the intent behind these sequences is clear, they often feel out of place and not fully integrated into the narrative, appearing more convenient than cohesive. Still, Sunshine is a compelling and important watch and not only for Maris Racal’s standout performance but for its bold and compassionate exploration of an issue that remains deeply relevant in modern Philippine society. It’s a film that provokes and ultimately shines.",2025-11-27,0,0,watch,False

vicsvaporub,8,"this feels very similar to brocka in that it portrays manila as a city full of hardship and loneliness that can leave you so disillusioned and alienated; and where hope and humanity exist on the fringes of it. it's a working-class story with working-class sentiments that fully takes on its own identity because jadaone is able to portray such familar elements in a way that feel completely isolating; the interiors of jeepneys, tricycles, shabby motels, clinics — everything feels so alien. which, i guess, offers many people unfamiliar with what these woman go through a much-needed perspective on the importance of dignity and bodily autonomy and how violent, horrible men try to take that away from many women.i think it's also worth noting that religion and patriarchy play such a prominent role here in oppression; jadaone laser-focused on placing religious beliefs and preconceived notions about abortion in the spotlight, all the more affected by teenage pregnancy and how religion has kind of shaped the way many filipinos treat abortion as something so taboo and inhuman that they completely forget how it affects the mother. and it's brought to life by a really incredible maris racal; shaped by all the adversity — the kind of performance that requires you to bare your soul to the audience, to beg them to see the humanity behind the people suffering from religious oppression, and why access to abortion services — even in a heavily catholic country — is of utmost importance.",2025-12-03,1,0,watch,True

At hindi ka maaapektuhan kung magdedesisyon ang isang tao na gawin yon.Fuck people with this kind of mindset.Imagine, nasa pedestrian lane ka, tapos tatanungin ka kung magpapakamatay ka? Tanga ka ba?Bibili ka lang ng pregnancy test, tapos ijjudge ka at sasabihing, “Mga kabataan ngayon hindi na marunong magpigil.” People just can’t shut their mouths.Fuck the government.Putangina nakakalungkot, everytime na may Pilipino na magkakasakit, una nilang iisipin ay wala silang pera, paano ang gagastusin, at kung anong ipangbabayad nila sa ospital, imbes na isipin ang kalusugan at mangyayari sa kanila.

Lalaki lang ba talaga? “Hindi ako nahihiya, ayoko maging nanay”This was the part where I literally cried, salamat, at least at some point narealize ko, may boses tayo, may karapatan tayong magdesisyon para sa sarili natin, may karapatan tayong piliin kung ano yung tama at mas makakapagpasaya satin.Gets ko na, salamat Sunshine.",2025-12-03,2,0,watch,True

sircylovesyou,10,"Women in the Philippines continue to grapple with deeply rooted issues such as teenage pregnancy which is made even more complex by the country’s predominantly Catholic identity. The moral codes and expectations instilled in us from childhood often determine whether society views abortion as a sinful act or a necessary choice, and this cultural tension becomes the silent force shaping many young women’s lives.In the film, Maris Racal embodies this struggle with striking emotional clarity. She carries the weight of a decision that no young woman should have to make alone: the impossible choice between holding on to her dream of becoming an Olympian or confronting the life-altering reality of an unexpected pregnancy. Her performance is powerful not because it dramatizes the dilemma, but because it mirrors the experiences of countless Filipinas whose voices are often dismissed or shamed into silence.What elevates the film is how it frames her situation not as a moral failure, but as a human story: one shaped by fear, hope, societal pressure, and the search for agency. Through Racal’s nuanced portrayal, the narrative exposes the cultural contradictions we live with: a society that celebrates the achievements of young women yet imposes rigid expectations on their bodies and choices. The film invites the audience to move beyond judgment and recognize the quiet courage required to stand at the crossroads of identity, aspiration, and responsibility.In grounding a personal crisis within the broader context of Philippine social norms, the film becomes more than a character study; it becomes a commentary on how we, as a society, often fail to extend empathy to young women navigating impossible circumstances. And in that sense, Maris does not just act the role; she embodies a truth many are too uncomfortable to confront.",2025-12-03,1,0,watch,True

THEN JERK OFF AND DON'T FUCK WOMEN!!What makes Sunshine haunt me is how real it feels — not just as a story of a gymnast’s dream, but as a raw, painful portrait of what it means to be young, afraid, and fighting when everything seems stacked against you. The moment the truth sinks in — that this girl, brimming with hope and ambition, is now carrying a life she never asked for — the world she built starts cracking. Maris Racal gives a performance that doesn’t feel like acting — even when she’s silent, you feel every tremor of fear, every doubt, every moment she prays for a different ending. The film doesn’t paint shades of grey — it throws you into a world where choices are dangerous, and every door seems closed.And the way the city closes in around her — tight alleys, cold clinics, judgmental stares, desperation disguised as quiet — Sunshine doesn’t just tell a story. It burrows underneath your skin and refuses to leave. This film isn’t easy or comfortable, but it’s needed — for the stories it refuses to sanitize, for the voices it pulls from the shadows, and for the courage it asks from us to look.

jazzphen,10,"Finally had a chance to watch this, i was meant to watch this when it was showing at the cinemas but so busy until recently saw news that it was gonna come out on Netflix so i was elated. Haha.I like it so much, i love the cast in this film, and i love seeing this kind of quality in Filipino movies which is super rare these days. The story is about a young woman who has a dream that she pursued her whole life and suddenly she becomes pregnant which risks this dream, and now she has to weigh everything carefully because either which choice she pick will be life-changing. The whole movie revolves around that and we get to be introduced to the characters and the environment around her that is essential and will influence the choice she will make. Here we get to see a real picture even though the story is fictional, as filipinos you could almost grasp the realness out of this film and say, this is the REALITY but we don't have to embrace it, WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT. As a man, I always believed that i am no position to speak about what women should and shouldn't do about their bodies, but will absolutely support the concept of abortion. When we speak about abortion in a country that is like the Philippines, that is so centered on religion, abortion becomes a taboo, illegal and unethical. We also see these professionals, government leaders that support this kind of ideology that abortion is bad blah blah blah. This film is a great commentary and an eye opener to what young women and women in general what they go through, and that abortion should become an option for all women in our society. I will just make it clear that i think this film is not pro abortion or anti life, without directly stating it, the film focuses on making better decisions, the importance of protection, sex is more common than we think which is ironic in the Philippines that is so religious but that’s ok, this country just needs proper education and thats it. PS. If you are going to argue with me about me being ok about abortion or use of protection, I’m going to tell you this, how dare you bring a life in this world, in this country that cant do anything about poverty, cant do anything about corrupt politicians, cant vote right, doesn't have an accessible healthcare and on top of that, if you’re a man, stfu, and if you’re a woman, who is not ready, physically, mentally and financially, Ari and that young girl doesn’t deserve to live like that, on the streets or getting abused. But if you are, financially stable, mentally stable and physically stable with a nice and healthy environment to grow a living thing then go fucking crazy.",2025-12-03,0,0,watch,False

The story requires someone who is capable of letting the viewers feel the heaviness of her pain, the agony, and the hope of standing up for yourself and for what you want, and she made us feel all of that. And though I may not completely agree with everything that's pointed out here, I really admire Jadaone's attempt and bravery at addressing such a taboo topic, not just in the Philippines but the rest of the world. Being prayerful and always going to church do not give us the right to see ourselves as being more morally upright than others. When you put all of that aside, Sunshine is just a teenager who regretfully made a mistake and who made a decision for herself, stood up for what she wanted, and spared the child from the resentment of a mom from being robbed of her own dreams, and of leading her to what could possibly be a miserable life.She knows she could be ridiculed for that decision, but she lived according to her own terms anyway.

flreu,10,"Ang hirap maging babaeng puno ng pangarap. The film Sunshine (2024) resonated with me because it honestly depicts how unforgiving reality can be. It shows how quickly people judge young women, often before they even have a chance to breathe or ask for help. The film also makes painfully clear how the lack of reproductive rights pushes women toward risky, sometimes dangerous choices. You can almost feel Sunshine being boxed in on all sides, not because she did anything wrong, but because society refuses to give her real options.Women in the Philippines face judgment, limited choices, and immense pressure around pregnancy. And the film makes a point I strongly agree with: no government or religious institution should dictate what a woman does with her body. Those decisions belong to the person living that reality, not to people watching from a distance.Sunshine made the right choice. Sobrang taboo sa Pilipinas ang usapang abortion, pero at least the child didn’t grow up feeling guilty or resenting their mother for what might have happened if they hadn’t been born. It’s better for a child to know they were truly wanted, rather than feeling like the product of someone else’s dilemma. Constantly being told they’re a blessing can’t replace the sense of being genuinely chosen.Sana ma-gets ng lahat si Sunshine.",2025-12-03,2,0,watch,True

I also love how this movie portrayed women who chose to have an abortion dahil pinakita rito na hindi madaling desisyon ang magpalaglag; kitang-kita ang struggles ng isang babae na hindi pa ready na maging isang ina.

mswholovesfilm,10,"SOBRA SOBRANG GANDA NG PELIKULA NI DIREK TONETsa sobrang ganda i had to watched it 2 times. hindi ko alam ma fefeel ko after kong unang panuodin ito, sobrang lungkot at bigat dahil alam kong hindi lang ito basta pelikula kundi realidad ng bawat babae, bawat tao, at bawat batang muntik makita ang mundo.i love the jeepney scene, It was a really heavy scene, I think it was me interpreting na iniisip na ni sunshine na 'bakit??, bakit saakin pa? baka hindi na ako makasama sa olympics na ito- bakit?' maybe there was this question of confusion na kahit siya hindi niya masagot.. na kahit saan siya dalhin ni kuya manong at ibaba dala dala parin niya talaga ito (yung bata)I loved how this film not only focuses on abortion rights, but also shows many of the real problems in the Philippines.Napakita talaga kung gaano ka–fucked up ang sistema ng mga hospital dito—kulang sa pasilidad, nagsisiksikan, at ang daming pwedeng mamatay dahil sa ganitong sistema. Sobrang nakakagalit isipin na sa hospital ka pa dapat may chance mabuhay, pero doon ka pa pwedeng bawian.It also shows the messed-up beliefs of people who think it’s “easy” to raise a child. Yung mga nagsasabing “takot mo sa una lang ‘yan” at “biyaya ‘yan ng Panginoon.” I’m not against their beliefs—they’re entitled to them—but I find it toxic. Paano mo kayang sabihin sa isang tao na “biyaya” ito kung galing sa karumaldumal at walang kamalay-malay na kasalanan ng ibang tao? Paano mo sasabihing tanggapin niya na lang ito?I think not everything can be called a blessing. And I don’t think it’s fair to say “binigay ito ng Diyos” kahit mali ang pinanggalingan. When I watched it for the second time, ang dami ko talagang na-notice. Naging malaking tanong sa’kin kung *paano* at *saan* narealize ni Sunshine ang lahat.At first, akala ko si Annika (yung batang babae) was her inner child someone who guides her, the version of herself who dreamed of becoming an Olympian but never got the chance.Yung part sa ilalim ng tulay, nung lumabas na si Ariana — doon ko talaga na-connect. I think Sunshine realized it too. Habang hinahanap niya si Sunshine, hindi siya mapakali. Naging question ko rin talaga kung paano kilala ni Sunshine si Ariana if kakakita niya lang dito? Diba??!And what Ariana said made sense. May part sa movie na sinabi niya na ayaw niyang bumalik sa bahay dahil wala namang may pakialam sa kanya. sabi ni Sunshine doon “Hindi, naguguluhan lang siya.” i think she was referring to marygrace.The conversation between Ariana and Annika (the little girl) really altered my brain.The way they pictured the life they could’ve had in a world they will never get to be part of sobrang bigat..And that line, “Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap ni Sunshine,” grabe.sobrang naiyak ako sa part ng ate niya at si sunshine, grave sobrang galing talaga ni direk tonet. tinanggap at inintindi niya ito ng buong buo mabuhay talaga ang pelikulang ito.Lastly! finally!(ang sobrang daming yap)the last part, yung “gets ko na.” Those words explained everything.It felt like Sunshine was saying,“I hope naiintindihan mo kung bakit ko ‘to ginagawa.”And i know that’s exactly how she felt.Maybe the girl can’t have the world.But no—actually, she did.Because she gave Sunshine the world she always wanted, even if she couldn’t have it herself. ""Pangarap ko kung anong pangarap niya""That “gets ko na” part really hit me.Sobrang bigat. And right after that line,there was a cut showing Sunshine in this moment of relief and it says so much kahit na walang description kahit walang explanation.i love this film na gustong kong yakapin si sunshine at hawakan ang kamay niya at sabihing ""hindi mo ito kasalanan""",2025-12-03,0,0,watch,True

yunqoui,10,"I have a lot of feelings to share about this beautiful and heartbreaking film. Truly a big eye-opener to many Filipinos.Women carry a biological physical pain we are given the moment we are born. Period, childbirth, postpartum, etc. But we also carry the pain this world and men cause. The pain men should be held accountable for. Emotional labour, cultural and religious expectations, rape, pregnancy, forms of abuse, etc. It's like our suffering is pre-written, pre-approved, and expected. And yet the world still has all the audacity to treat us as if we're lesser, fragile, dramatic, overreacting. I think I will never be able to understand the logic of a world that demands strength from women and then punishes us for being strong.Like Sunshine and Menggay, a lot of women out there don't have choices. A lot of women are already deprived of basic rights before they even learn to speak. But then again, society still keeps finding new ways to take more from them.The hypocrisy of the Filipinos in this film is also insane but couldn’t be more well depicted. (It’s actually so much worse in real life.) Filipinos will praise God with one hand and strip women of autonomy with the other. Anti-abortion because “God said so,” but silent about abuse, poverty, rape cases, or the girls forced into motherhood long before they even have the chance to understand themselves. They defend unborn children better than they defend the living women who have to endure the burden of carrying them. Because if they don’t, you will judge them. You will shame them. How is that love? How is that morality? Abortion is criminalized, but sexual abuse cases get dismissed.It’s exhausting. It’s enraging.To all of the Sunshines out there, gets na gets ko kayong lahat. The world keeps underestimating and shaming us, but here we are, still standing, still surviving.To end this, I want to share that one monologue in Fleabag that came back to me after watching this film and inspired my entire review:""Women are born with pain built in. It's our physical destiny—period pains, sore boobs, childbirth. We carry it within ourselves throughout our lives. Men don't. They have to seek it out. They invent all these gods and demons so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we do very well on our own. And then they create wars so they can feel things and touch each other and when there aren't any wars they can play rugby. We have it all going on in here, inside. We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years, and then just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens? The menopause comes. The fucking menopause comes and it is the most wonderful fucking thing in the world. Yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get fucking hot and no one cares, but then you're free. No longer a slave, no longer a machine with parts. You're just a person.""",2025-11-28,2,0,watch,True

letshencook,8,"It was true when they said that this was a brave film. To be one of the first films in pinoy cinema to explore a pro-choice and an unwanted pregnancy narrative is indeed brave, especially when you know the Philippines’ socio-political and religious climate around topics regarding sex, female desires, pregnancy, bodily autonomy, and parenthood.There were unfortunately some parts of the film that felt like they didn’t work.I’m not sure but Sunshine’s decision to abort felt too quick. And her dream to be an Olympian felt underexplored and more of her coach’s. We’re told rather than shown that it was hers.The inclusion of Annika Co whose character can be interpreted as Sunshine’s subconscious/ego or unborn child or whatnot sometimes felt irritating to watch (sorry not sorry). But I guess to reach more towards a predominantly Filipino audience and to highlight Sunshine still being a (teen) child who’s forced to confront the consequences of her choices by a child: worked? I don’t know. Not to mention that it felt a little silly to include two other characters, where one was another pregnant teen girl, that lowkey felt like their stories were being shoved down to the audience’s throats. And in the end, felt shallow. I just think that I hoped they showed more of the technicalities of her being an athlete. Rhythmic gymnastics is considered an elite sport. And when you consider it in the Philippine context – the film didn’t really show what was at stake of being an athlete in this sport. The film’s strong aspects are definitely on the score, cinematography (particularly to highlight the corners of Manila as this chaotic, packed, and cruel city), and of course: Maris’ performance as Sunshine. There were scenes that hit hard and heavy. The irony of abortion drugs sold and found in the street outside a church. The motel scene to show Sunshine’s quiet desperation. Her final rehearsal for her routine before her “gets ko na” scene with Annika (where I cried unfort bcz luteal phase duh).The film does show you a glimpse of the unforgiving reality of what many Filipino women go through everyday: teenage pregnancy, overcrowded and underfunded public hospitals, and the lack of comprehensive sexuality education about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health. It lacked, sure. But I guess, for pinoy cinema to start tackling difficult topics such as this: it’s a start.",2025-12-02,1,0,watch,False

I've always believed that the woman is the one that should decide on what to do with an unwanted pregnancy. So, to see pros and cons of wanting to abort a child as well as choosing to go through abortion was quite engaging and I understand things more now. To see the horrors of using illegal ways of abortion was eye-opening, in all honesty. The film did a fantastic job of showcasing these issues, as the message was loud, clear and perfect. I'd say that my only issue with this film is that I wish the story was more fleshed out in a way. Also, it was blatantly obvious that the mysterious (and annoying, mind you) little girl was Sunshine's supposed daughter. I would've honestly preferred it if it wasn't made obvious.",2025-12-02,1,0,watch,False

iceddunkin,6,"First Letterboxd essay — I had an itch to scratch so bad with this one. Also medyo late, crammer kasi year-end na :) Right off the bat, I knew how reviews of this film would look like. At hindi naman nagkamali. This film is highly praised, receiving remarks such as masterpiece, brave, and a stepping stone.Yet to my surprise, a few share the same sentiments I had, thoughts that were brewing in me while watching Sunshine. Kaya rin ang hirap buuin ng review na ito (bukod sa hindi naman talaga ako nag-eessay sa plataporma na ito), kasi ayoko maging echo lamang.Anyways, just for the sake of sharing kahit onti:(1) I agree that the supposed personified child is, safe to say, contradictory. Kahit may explanation si Direk Jadaone, it still felt conflicting and made the film unsure of itself.(2) The introduction of some characters felt out of place. In some aspect parang chess yan, character placement and arcs matter, so the player must be aware of their moves.(3) The slap in the face commentary on religion felt overdone. Sayang ang parts and points na pwede pang mahimay.Oh diba, dami niyang sinasabi. But in all honesty, I really felt the need to essay the hell out of this review. Mahalaga sa akin ang usapang SRH at syempre mahalaga rin sa akin na maging diskurso ito.And dahil diyan, here’s a point I feel no one else has raised. Personally, it felt like under-researched ang pelikula. Bakit? Mababaw pa ang na-capture nitong realidad ng abortion at ang hirap na nadadanas ng kababaihan sa kalusugan. These are things you would know agad with one simple search on Reddit. Gets ba? (Lol) And to think na mas layered and complex pa dapat ito sa sitwasyon ni Sunshine, as a student-athlete with financial instability. Sayang lang, ano? Syempre may good points din ang Sunshine sa pananaw ko. Visually, it did its thing. Acting, no doubt, great talents, especially Maris and Jennica. The fact that I watched this with my parents and that they were genuinely interested and concerned about the film is a good point.Sa dulo naman, baka expectations ko rin ang rason kaya ko ito naisip.

How would she even know? lol aside from that, we could’ve explored more of why this sport is so important to her instead of adding a subplot (that 13 yr old girl case) that makes her situation feel less serious.her feelings and reasons are all valid but that subplot makes her look careless and kinda dumb lol so it’s hard to root for her tbh 🤷‍♀️also, her imaginary child looks cute, healthy, and fun to talk with... why would she think of aborting her if that’s what her imaginary child is going to look like growing up?????? the imaginary child should reflect the life she can’t give or the pressure she feels or at least something burdensome that is so much worse, not some fantasy lolz. gets na niya, hinayaan niya, tinaggap nalang niya ang fate niya kahit imaginary siya.",2025-12-02,0,0,watch,True
sunjazzfilms,5,"I’ll be honest, underwhelming siya for me. Siguro tumaas lang expectations ko dahil sa dami ng reviews na nakita ko sa social media (na hindi ko binasa para iwas spoiler) at syempre dahil sa haba ng theatrical run niya. What I genuinely liked were the performances. They hired competent actors, and it shows. And since marami na rin akong napanood na Jadaone films, andun pa rin ’yun trademark angst niya—and I love that for her.Ang hindi ko kinaya ay ’yun imaginary children. Siguro kasi sobrang dami ko nang nakitang ganitong atake sa short films at full-length lalo na kapag tungkol sa abortion kaya hindi na bago sa paningin ko. I get kung bakit siya ginamit as a plot device to feel “innovative,” especially with a message that wants to tell the masses na okay lang piliin ang sarili at magpa-abort. Importanteng mensahe ’yun.Kaso… hindi ako nadala emotionally. May mga babae akong kakilala na nagpa-abort at grabe ’yun pinagdaanan nila. Compared sa mga kwentong narinig ko, ang nipis lang ng emotional experience ni Sunshine sa film. Kaya siguro nainis ako sa imaginary children na atake. The feeling itself of learning you're pregnant tapos mag-decide to get an abortion already carries so many complex emotions. Hindi mo na kailangan idikit pa ’yun mga bata to prove a point.Hindi ko rin nagustuhan na parang ang babaw ng pagkakahandle sa kwento nung batang na-rape ng tito niya. Pakiramdam ko ibang pelikula dapat ’yun—isang pelikula na mas malalim at mas handang i-tackle ’yun bigat ng topic.Feeling ko kung lalaki ka, baka mas ""oks"" itong film para sayo.

Social media is used several times throughout the start of the film, but none of it is cliché or abhorrent. Each social media is used in a very relatable way, which kind of shocked me but it was a feature of the film I really appreciated. Sunshine’s panic is so realistic and grounding too, the performance is amazing. In terms of tonal shifting, the film does a really great job at keeping it’s theme and message intense and suffocating, much like Sunshine’s need to make a decision.

It feels unsettling to watch how easily society dismisses the experiences of women, as if their lives become secondary the moment they become pregnant. I can’t ignore how deeply this connects to the patriarchal norms I’ve grown up seeing. From subtle expectations to outright judgment, there is a long history of controlling women’s bodies and decisions. The shame placed on those who consider or seek abortion is not just personal; it is cultural and religious, embedded in systems that teach us to shame and question women’s choices instead of supporting them. This made us more aware of how easily society turns compassion into condemnation when it comes to reproductive health.P'wede ba pag walang matres, 'wag na bumoses?",2025-12-02,0,0,watch,False

Jadaone films always stab softly, pero ito? Parang dahan-dahang hinihiwa yung dibdib, layer by layer, para ipakita yung takot, pangarap, at kahihiyang matagal nang nakatago sa ilalim ng “ok lang ako.”this is the kind of film na hindi mo papanoorin para gumaan ang loob mo, papanoorin mo siya para maalala kung gaano kabigat mabuhay bilang babae sa bansang ayaw umamin na may mali sa sistemang sinasamba nito. Sunshine doesn’t preach. it just stands there, raw and trembling, asking the kind of questions we’re trained to avoid:Paano ka pipili kung lahat ng choice mo ay kasalanan sa mata ng iba?Paano ka lalaban kung mismong katawan mo ang pinaparusahan?Maris Racal is devastating in ways na hindi loud pero lumalalim. hindi siya yung tipikal na dramatic heroine — she’s simply a girl suspended between a dream and a reality that keeps shrinking her choices. her silence says more than any monologue could. every frame feels like a confession: hesitant, trembling, pero totoo.and what struck me most wasn’t the gymnastics, or even the central issue of abortion. it was the ache between who we want to become and what our circumstances force us to be. nakakapagod maging babae sa Pilipinas — laging may moral lesson, laging monitored, laging may takot na isang maling galaw lang, tapos na ang lahat. parang ang liit liit ng mundo mo kahit ang laki laki ng pangarap mo.Sunshine doesn’t romanticize any of this. walang sermon, walang cinematic gloss. just a raw, unfiltered look at how dreams bruise under a society na mas mabilis manghusga kaysa umintindi. the film’s imperfections — the loose ends, the uneven metaphors, the sometimes rushed stakes — oddly work in its favor. because real life isn’t clean. hindi linear ang trauma. hindi laging malinaw ang choice. and maybe that’s the point: that we’re all navigating a world built not on empathy, but on fear and control.in the end, Sunshine feels less like a movie and more like a mirror — one that forces you to sit with the darkness until you finally admit na masakit talaga ang liwanag. it’s an eye-opener not because it shocks, but because it whispers truths we’ve mastered the art of ignoring.a film worth watching, not because it entertains, but because it confronts. because it nudges you to look beyond the screen and into the world we built… and ask, Bakit ganito?And more importantly — hanggang kailan?",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,False

We failed our women! Antoinette jadaone’s SUNSHINE is powerful , poignant, beautiful, and yet heartbreaking which showcases the crisis of young age pregnancy, the taboo and the shame comes with it, hypocrisy of society and being resilient and standing up for yourself and for your dreams over anyone. It’s not a fairytale, but a hard hitting truth. There is no ending to this cycle of shame for women who are bred in this macho-feudal society, how religion and social taboos remain a bottleneck than a savior. But the movie overcomes those things so bravely and leads a courageous path to tell women to take their rights in their own hands. I really loved the idea of her imaginative child being with her all the time, giving her strength, and emotional support and that final moment between those two is tear jerking. What most people think it was a sad ending, but actually it was not, it was an inspiring ending which reaffirms that every woman should have the right to make a decision for herself. Abortion is actually less cruel than bringing a baby in this hell hole and making its life shitty, when its parents are not capable of taking care of it mentally, physically, financially and emotionally.

bettersweet,10,"Nakakalungkot lang. Basta. It brought me back to the Fangirl days when it gave me the chills about how being a delulu can bring you to your worst disappointments. But this time, Sunshine hits different. When you realize what she did to achieve her dreams, you'd be flabbergasted. It's giving The Unforgivable dilemma. Biktima lang din talaga si Sunshine ng circumstances.Sunshine is just one of the many girls in the society who still get solely blamed for the acts that should also be blamed on the boys. This movie is not just your typical feminist film; it speaks of depth, especially on the challenges of women and the dilemma they face. Isa pa sa nagustuhan ko sa film na to is yung pinadama niya yung hopelessness ni Sunshine. Di naman sa ayaw ko ng movies na binibigyan ng pag-asa ang main character sa huli, pero this served something different and it worked. It's when she was forced to choose between two things, and ended up choosing what's best for her, even if it meant—basta. May empathy ka pa din kay Sunshine kahit labag sa iyong kalooban ang kanyang gagawin (as a Filipino Catholic).Sobrang ironic lang din ng title, which I admire.

Importantly, the film is not a pro-life statement, nor does it romanticize suffering or prescribe motherhood as a moral imperative. instead, it shows that the choices women face are complex, constrained, and often invisible to those who hold power.it also addresses the ways women navigate survival under these pressures. it shows that women are often responsible for both care work and emotional labor without recognition or support. the everyday reality of harassment, unsafe streets, economic vulnerability, and social judgment creates conditions in which reproductive choice becomes a deeply personal but politically fraught decision. the film does not moralize these choices; it presents them with nuance, empathy, and a refusal to simplify the stakes into a pro-life narrative.at higit sa lahat, thank you, sunshine, sa pagpukpok ng bote sa tito.",2025-12-01,1,0,watch,True

forgetlilacw,8,"This is a blistering, gut-punching film that doesn’t just ask difficult questions about bodily autonomy and Olympic dreams; it screams them into the humid, chaotic reality of Manila. It’s a brave, essential piece of cinema that confronts the devastating consequences of living in a country where a woman’s control over her own body is perpetually under threat. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and utterly visceral—it’s relentless, trapping us inside Sunshine’s suffocating anxiety. Jadaone uses the oppressive visual texture of Quiapo’s crowded, sweltering streets—a perfect, gritty backdrop—to symbolize the labyrinthine journey of a young woman navigating impossible choices in a system designed to fail her.A massive and well-deserved standing ovation goes to the central performances. Maris Racal is devastating as the titular gymnast, embodying the crushing physical and emotional burden with every strained muscle and every desperate, silent plea. Her performance is a masterclass in controlled despair, capturing the agony of a lifetime of sacrifice being threatened in an instant. She is perfectly complemented by Annika Co’s mesmerizing, eerie, and unrelenting presence as the Kid—an unsettling narrative device that functions as both Sunshine’s internal critic and her desperate conscience. But let’s be real: the film’s rawest emotional hook comes from the shocking failure and apathy of the men around her. Their irresponsibility and sheer lack of accountability form a central, infuriating symbol of the patriarchal society that traps Sunshine.Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. Every day feels like a battle against a society na paulit-ulit kang nilalagay sa kahon, insisting that your worth begins and ends with motherhood. Fuck the stigma na finoforce ang mga kababaihan into roles they never agreed to—parang automatic default na lang na dapat tahimik, dapat magtiis, dapat magpakamartir. Walang puwang para sa sariling pangarap, sariling katawan, sariling desisyon.Kaya sana mas umingay at mas mapag-usapan ang Reproductive Rights—hindi lang as a “women’s issue” but as a basic human right. This is about giving women the freedom to choose, the safety to seek care without judgment, and the dignity to exist without being shamed or controlled. Hanggang hindi natin tinatalakay nang seryoso ang mga ito, paulit-ulit lang tayo sa cycle ng stigma, trauma, at kawalan ng choices.Being a woman here shouldn't feel like a punishment. It shouldn't demand silence in exchange for survival.

YOU DID IT AGAIN!first of all, this should be more relevant than it is. being pro choice and growing up somehow religious, I know what other people think of abortion. especially yung mga sagradong katoliko. and that scene where sunshine went to church and immediately begged for forgiveness showcased EXACTLY THAT. (religious guilt!!!) it perfectly captures how the film isn’t just telling a story, but also reflecting a very real internal conflict na ang daming pinoy women who quietly deals with—yung clash between what you personally believe is right for your body and what your religion tells you is a sin. ang bigat pakinggan at panoorin.""buntis lang ako, 'di to nakakahawa""kahit sa kapwa babae natin di mapipigilan yung judgement eh. kasi ganun yung pagpapalaki satin which is honestly fucked up. and that line hits SO hard because it’s a commentary on how society treats pregnancy like a moral failure instead of a situation that needs support, empathy, and actual options. the film shows how even other women, who should’ve been supporting you, end up policing each other because yun yung environment na kinalakihan natin. tangina diba?!!?also the irony of buying abortion pills at a church and you can't get a room at a motel ALONE?? the system makes it impossible for women to make decisions about their own bodies, pero at the same time they judge you for every workaround you try to do. also for young girls who get raped and still, THEY have to deal with the consequences. it exposes how the philippines forces women into shame, secrecy, and inconvenience—and then they act shocked when women feel unsafe or unsupported. it’s painfully real, and so, so on point.overall, i love this movie because it's honest in a way that most local films are too scared to be. some women don't have a choice, and it's important that WE DO HAVE A CHOICE.

feldelrey,10,"What stayed with me long after the credits rolled is how Sunshine understands the quiet corners of being young. The ones filled with fear you don’t even have language for yet, and the hope you still hold anyway. The film doesn’t chase shock value; instead, it trusts stillness, letting the soft ache of its characters speak for themselves.And then there’s that storyline about the 13-year-old girl, pregnant because of her own uncle. OH GOD. That shattered me. It’s horrifying, devastating, and the film doesn’t sanitize the truth of it. It shows how violence like that hides inside families, how children are left carrying consequences for sins that were never theirs. I felt so much grief and anger for that kid; it’s the kind of scene that makes you sit there and go quiet because it hurts in a very real way. The film’s exploration of choice, shame, and the pressure to “grow up correctly” hits even harder because of moments like that. It never lectures. It simply shows how heavy it is to carry circumstances shaped by adults who should’ve protected you. Maris Racal delivers an immaculate kind of devastation in this role. There’s a sharpness to every look she gives, a trembling truth in every word, that feels painfully real. She breaks open the character’s longing, lets the fear spill out raw, and turns her strength into something that rises slowly from the wreckage. It’s a performance that destroys you and stays spotless in its honesty.Sunshine is the kind of film that lingers. Soft, bruising, furious when it needs to be, and quietly bright in all the places that matter.",2025-12-01,3,0,watch,True

As someone working in the healthcare field, I believe the movie highlights an important truth: abortion should not be treated as a taboo subject or inherently immoral. Whether we acknowledge it or not, there are women who do not wish to become pregnant or are not ready to become mothers. Criminalizing abortion does not stop it from happening; it merely drives women toward unsafe procedures that place their lives at greater risk.If one personally identifies as pro-life, then one has the choice not to pursue abortion. However, holding that belief does not grant anyone the authority to dictate or restrict what women can do with their own bodies, especially when they do not contribute to the wellbeing of the child these women may be forced to bear. The health, autonomy, and safety of women must remain our priority.

intjyhnn,10,"Ang pelikulang Sunshine ay hindi lang simpleng kwento ng isang babae—isa itong salamin sa maraming isyung matagal nang umiikot sa Pilipinas pero pilit pa ring isinasantabi. Nagawa ng pelikula ito na ilahad ang mga sakit ng sistemang kinabibilangan natin: mula sa pakikibaka ng kababaihan sa kanilang sariling katawan hanggang sa nakakalungkot na estado ng ating healthcare system.Isa sa pinakamalinaw na ipinupukol ng pelikula ay ang isyu ng aborsyon. Ipinapakita ng pelikula kung gaano kahirap ang desisyong hinaharap ng mga kababaihan—lalo na sa bansang halos bawal pag-usapan ang reproductive rights. Nakakahalit dahil hanggang ngayon, marami pa ring kababaihan ang hindi ganap na malaya sa sarili nilang katawan dahil sa malalim na kapit ng konserbatismong relihiyoso. Sa halip na suportahan, hinuhusgahan sila. Sa halip na pakinggan, pinapatahimik. At gaya ng ipinapakita sa pelikula, napipilitang harapin ng mga babae ang mga sitwasyong hindi nila pinili, wala man lang ligtas o legal na option para makaligtas..Kasunod nito, mariing binabangga ng pelikula ang realidad ng ating healthcare system. Hindi na bago ang nakikitang eksena sa ospital: siksikan, kulang sa gamit, at kapos sa espasyo. Dalawa, minsan tatlong ina sa iisang kama—hindi dahil gusto nila, kundi dahil wala talagang mapaglagyan. Ito ang reyalidad na hinaharap ng ordinaryong Pilipino araw-araw, habang ang mga pulitikong may kapangyarihan ay kayang lumipad paabroad para magpagamot sa mas kumpletong pasilidad.Sa kabuuan, nagsilbing boses ang Sunshine para sa mga isyung matagal nang dinidinig ngunit hindi pinakikinggan.

danii_2,9,"This movie was fun to watch in terms of its setting. I have been to the gym Sunshine was training in and also the Rizal Sports Complex because I have trained there before in 2015!Argh, teenage pregnancy in the Philippines stems from the lack of sex education and advocacy for contraceptives and abortion. The fact that we are a mostly Catholic-dominated country or population that strongly adheres to tradition makes it harder for pregnant teenagers to find support. They are made to feel ashamed and helpless because even the law says that abortion is illegal, meaning that they do not have a choice but to deliver the child. Sunshine's passion was found in gymnastics, something that she couldn't let go of. She knew that if she were to become a mother (which she isn't ready for, as she explicitly states during her conversation with Miguel and his father), she would have to surrender everything she has worked hard for. Her sister's situatio, who was a former gymnast as well, basically shows that Sunshine's life would eventually become just like hers if she were to proceed with the pregnancy. The doctor was so annoying because that's exactly how the older generation sounds like when stating their opinions about religion, abortion, and chilbirth.I also liked the fact that they tackled topics like sex, autonomy, rape, and incest. These are very real in the Philippines and the situation with Ariana and his sister (?) greatly displayed how messed up it is. These children have no choice or power over their elders and what makes it sad is that those who should be protecting them are the ones putting them in danger and ruining their lives.I read somewhere that the little girl that followed Sunshine was her unborn child. I also thought of this throughout the movie and it even made more sense when the little girl said ""Gets ko na"" after Sunshine practiced her piece with a passionate smile and aura that could be felt by the audience.I love that Sunshine chose herself and her dreams over being a mother. A child born into this world who would eventually live in substandard conditions just because people say they should be born won't truly experience a life that should be lived.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

Also, I appreciate how this movie shows na accessing safe abortion care from clinics is far better than relying on herbal remedies or sa mga faithhealers. And of course, this also shows the effects of our flawed healthcare system, it's inaccessible and expensive, pushing women to resort to those kinds of practices. But, It's important to remember that we have the rights to make a choice about our own bodies, but we should make those choices wisely and safely.",2025-12-01,0,0,watch,True

dicotalvarado,9,"Ganda. A harrowing, claustrophobic, yet essential sprint across Manila streets. The craft here really shines, at just 90 or so minutes the film feels tightly-paced and confidently crafted through Jadaone's masterful direction, yet it still swings wide over several discussions and thoughts over its major theme in an arguably short amount of time. Mind you there's an element here that I'm not the biggest fan of-- I think the film could have actually eliminated it altogether as it feels inelegant especially against the overt realism of the rest of the film. But otherwise it's easy to overlook this compared to how wise the rest of the film is. It culminates in a truly lovely finale that uses simplicity to great, moving effect, especially when juxtaposed to how much noise and haste the rest of the film's heavy atmosphere is. Gets ko na why ""Gets ko na"" became an easily recognisable, even arguably iconic line from this film.Besides the stellar direction, the rest of the departments here really shine. The camera and production design really stand out here, painting a crowded and cramped world. The performances are simply captivating. Maris Racal truly carries this hefty narrative, but Annika Co really exudes such natural confidence that steals the scene whenever she appears. Ultimately, this really feels like important cinema from simply one of the best Filipino filmmakers out there.",2025-12-01,2,0,watch,True

Wala sa kahit anong batas or salita ng diyos ang makatutulong sa mga taong kagaya ni Sunshine, kung 'di ang maayos na health care system, maayos at tapat na gobyerno, at isang mapagpalayang lipunan — malaya sa kahit anong dikta at husga ng mga taong hindi kailanma'y namroblema sa kanilang kaligtasan kapag maglalakad mag-isa sa madilim na kalsada, sa kanilang kasuotan at pananamit, sa kung anong pananaw ng iba sa kanilang katawan, sa kakayahan makapag-luwal ng anak, sa mga tingin at pagnanasa ng mga mabababang-uri, at sa mga marami pang bagay. Napakaraming aspeto ng pelikulang Sunshine ang paulit-ulit sinasampal sa atin para lang magising sa realidad ang bulok na lipunang 'to.

asheng,8,"This film really reminded me that sometimes even the most seemingly trivial decisions—like whether to use a condom or not by relying on the excuse of pulling out—can have huge effects on one’s life. It also shows how having no access to proper medical care for abortion (since it is illegal) is so unfair, especially for children who were taken advantage of, which leads them to use unsafe methods that put their lives at risk. I really applaud Sunshine’s determination to chase her dreams and stay strong in the face of her friends ignoring her and her boyfriend not wanting to take responsibility for their child. Aside from her, I also applaud her family for staying by her side regardless of what her decision may be. I applaud this film for showing the hardships of being a woman—specifically, a woman in the Philippines—surrounded by noise, distractions, and judgment.",2025-12-01,1,0,watch,True

matteodo_,9,"""Naiintindihan mo na?""""Gets ko na.""Whenever somebody asks me why I support abortion, I will ask them to watch this film—especially now that it is widely accessible through Netflix. The ability to choose for a woman's own welfare and decide for the future of a child is a fundamental right, it should never be a debate. Bodily autonomy is a human right. We can use religious morals as a basis to weigh the decision but NEVER force it on somebody and leverage that same bullshit to guilt-trip them. Safe-sex should be promoted not shushed by religious parties; accessible care for abortion should be a must We shouldn't demonize doctors and women who want that for themselves. Like the line, ""Flush out the noise"", these unneeded external noises should never be heard in the first place, all throughout the film it catches up to Sunshine. Hangang, hanga, ako sa'yo Sunshine. Dreams should never be impeded because of a mistake, she's still a teen who's transitioning to adulthood. She should be allowed to live her life not being worried about a child she never wanted in the first place. And to all the women out there, who's met with arguably stronger hostility, I hope that laws, people, the Philippines becomes more friendly to you. It should be like that. I never doubted Maris Racal's ability to act, and all I can say is they found jackpot by casting her as Sunshine and casting Annika as the little girl that appears all throughout the film.

mobh100,9,"“usapang bata to!””bakit? bata rin naman ako!”a striking detail that struck me the most is the contrast between the very first time we watch sunshine step onto the mat and the last time she ever does. at first, you hear this deep and intense noise of her drowning the music, her choach’s instructions, and even the sound of her own breathing. and the noise only goes louder and harsher each time we see her practice her routine while she quietly endures the devastating ordeal of attempting to terminate her pregnancy. what started off as a sound to describe her pressure and desperation to reach her olympic dreams, now becomes the sound of her fear, her secrecy, and her grief. this says so much about what it means to be a woman in the philippines: how suffering must be hidden, how autonomy becomes something to apologize for, and how you’re expected to quietly tend to your own wounds you never asked to carry.and sunshine carries her decision with guilt, so much that she looks at the unnamed young girl like she’s staring at every version of her future that never got the chance to choose. but she dreams. she dreams so much. and she dreams for more. and she stands firm, because what’s so wrong about wanting a life that belongs to her? what’s so wrong about refusing to be swallowed by sacrifice? what’s so wrong about refusing to become another woman she didn’t want to be?“gets ko na.”so as we see the last time she practices on the mat, we finally hear the sound of the music, not the deep sound of pressure of fear, but a rhythm that finally belongs to her. the gymnasium is dark, she’s alone and she’s pale, but this is the brightest she has ever looked in the past hour i’ve watched the film. she moves with a softness that feels earnest, like this is the first time her body isn’t performing to impress or survive, only to exist. she dances gracefully, probably the most she ever has, and it’s a moment that shows us that she has unapologetically reclaimed something no one ever thought she deserved: the right to choose herself. and for the first time, she is no longer a girl she’s afraid to be—she is a woman who has already decided.i hope more people watch sunshine (2024) not to criticize women with early and unintended pregnancies, but to meet them with grace and empathy for their fears, their confusion, and their fight to claim what should have always been theirs in the first place—their autonomy, dignity, and right to have access to healthcare without being made to beg for it.patuloy nating pahalagahan ang kalusugan, karapatan, at mga kwento ng kababaihan 💙minus half star kasi parang kaya pa natin i-improve yung dialogues, direk??

Antoinette Jadaone's best film yet so far, and i'd say it because of its boldness, for addressing an elephant, a taboo topic that most of us are not ready to talk about, but eventually we must. it's already hard enough that we don't have proper access to healthcare, even worse to be scrutinized by society simply for choosing yourself.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False

nelletella,8,"”Ay nako! Talaga naman ang mga kabataan ngayon hindi na makapagpigil.”Throughout Sunshine, there are several adult figures that do not listen to Sunshine, blinded by either their convictions or Filipino societal norms. They push Sunshine on what she must do: pray, seek forgiveness, give the baby a life, be a mom, and pray. In the adults’ eyes, Sunshine is not a nineteen-year-old Filipina in Manila going to school and practice. To the adults, Sunshine is already a mom.On Saturday, the Filipino noontime show It’s Showtime invited parents with 7 or more children for their game Laro, Laro, Pick. A majority of the contestants were women, and two of the mothers interviewed, Elsa and Rosalie, had 15 and 8 children respectively. Elsa, the 63-year-old woman with 12 living children and 3 deceased children recited the ages of her 12 children from the oldest, 46, to the youngest, 24. The gap between the older ones is 1-2 years apart, while the younger ones are about 2-3 years apart. Elsa confesses how difficult life is for her and her children, spouting how without God she would not be as strong as she is today, living off 300 pesos everyday. When Vice Ganda asked Elsa why she has so many children, Elsa plainly said, “Ehhh di ako marunong mag family planning eh,” inciting some laughter in the audience. Elsa even revealed that the father was absent and had a different family, leaving the Filipina mother and her 12 living children to figure out how to live.The second woman, Rosalie, with 8 children echoed the same sentiments as Elsa. She sells sampaguita every day with no days off at the age of 60 something; her children married and had their children early; the highest level of schooling one of her children attained was high school, but never graduated; her children sell sampaguita with no days off; and she has 19 grandchildren to look after in a home with no roof above their heads.What Sunshine, Elsa, and Rosalie have in common is how the patriarchy confines them to suffocating religious ideals, a corrupt and conservative government, and poor healthcare. What Sunshine does not have in common with the two women is the ignorance in family planning. Sunshine is no one's mother! It should never be a reason to have 7 or more children at an early age, with no means of support financially and emotionally, because it is ""God's gift,"" or because they simply want to experience having children. The favorite catchphrase, ""Kase malakas ako, kaya ko to"" can only thrive for so long with honesty until oppressors abuse the Filipina determination. Access to sexual education MUST be a right, not a privilege nor a taboo subject. Children do not decide when they want to be born, so there should be conscious efforts to assess if the environment people live in can secure their children's/childrens' future(s), especially in a country like the Philippines. Unfortunately, there are connections to poverty and the lack of interest and access to proper education. There is also the inability for Filipinos in poverty to seek other options, or have the real agency to pursue aspirations. While there is such thing as being irresponsible, Filipino women are a laughingstock in conversations surrounding teen pregnancy and reproductive rights—when realistically—they should have the choice to protect themselves, but are instead ruthlessly flayed off by the very system that commands kindness.[Minor spoilers ahead]Annika Co manifests herself as (what I think) Sunshine's Catholic guilt. We first meet Annika after Sunshine prays outside of Quiapo Church and is about to light a cigarette. Annika appears whenever Sunshine does something that will affect the fetus, and often berates Sunshine for being ""bad."" At first, I was hesitant towards the idea of Annika representing Sunshine's potential child, because it can mistakenly support the pro-life argument of murder (which Annika actually yells at Sunshine), until Annika says, ""ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya."" SOBRANG bigat yung line na yan! In a sense, Sunshine and Annika are the same person. Sunshine should be able to pursue her dreams successfully the same way Annika, along with other living and future children, should feel secure enough to be ambitious. The message further builds itself with Ariana, Annika's friend and the 13-year-old girl's potential child. Ariana wants to be the first gay president, but how can they do that in an environment with a r*pist, a neglectful grandmother, and a KID whose choice was stolen?If mothers like Elsa and Rosalie can somehow ""get away"" with no family planning, how can Sunshine and the 13-year-old girl survive in a Catholic Philippines? The Reproductive Health Law was passed in December 2012, and efforts to educate the masses and distribute contraceptives have improved, yet there is still a high percentage of unintended pregnancies, AIDS rates, and JUSKO PO—ISSUES WITH BUDGETING (source 1),(source 2) !!!!!! The Philippines will never progress as a nation if objectivity is blocked by the grip the church and the state have on one another, which ultimately and consistently harms Filipinas who give their best yesterday, today, and tomorrow.I am certain that Sunshine is not the first film to be unapologetically bold and loud for the Filipina, but it is certainly the first to make rounds among the casual movie-goers and the general Filipino. It is not a perfect film and such flawed instances are where:- the narrative of Sunshine being an Olympic-level athlete clashes with the lack of popularity shown outside of practice- the cinematography is poetic without a doubt, but the scenes of Sunshine messaging her Coach, Miggy, and Thea isn't synchronized with Sunshine typing on the phone/isn't even her actually texting. If you're going to place emphasis on the quietest scenes, I believe that something as minor as texting should be clean (this was the same quip I had with the controller scene in Anora like c'mon now....)- the cinematography can be too poetic. for example, the shot of Sunshine looking out of her hotel window with the Metro Manila noise juxtaposing her quiet turmoil contributes to Sunshine purposely not drowning out the noise (or the failure to?), but I found it unnecessary because right after she woke up in pain. the juxtaposition felt like it was purely for aesthetics- the Jojo Rabbit esque character of Annika and Ariana was VERY risky (re: pro-life arguments)- maybe it's just me but the film gives you some breathers with comedic aspects in things like ""no bad words"" and Annika proceeding to say ""putangina"" which I found myself like ""damn girl ! ! !"" though it makes me wonder if those who do not share the same ideals as me laughed at it the same way the audience laughed at Elsa in Laro Laro Pick. In a not long-winding way, and assuming negatively, if tonal shifts struck the audience as a serious matter and not a reactionary narrative.- the last 3 paragraphs of this review regarding how art can effectively stand by its purposeAng hirap maging isang Sunshine sa Pilipinas, at hindi pinaguusapan kahit eto ang reality ng karamihan ng babae at batang babae. Women can dream for themselves. Women can learn to protect for themselves if there are resources available by sources that make themselves available. Women are strong, but you cannot glorify them to always be strong at the expense of exploitation. Sunshine is many of the first steps in Philippine cinema that can continue the conversation. I hope the film incites action in Filipinos to call out the current and future administration, who, under the guise of a devotee to a forgiving religion, perpetuates being uncritical and whose laziness is a disservice to the Filipino people. And most importantly, may Filipinos denounce the administration's vigor in committing violence against them, and reclaim the autonomy all Filipinos are born with.",2025-11-30,2,0,watch,True

You can still reach what you want and chase your dreams.

Every choice you make shapes your future. We may not regret our actions in the moment, but we regret them later.And for other men, I want to say this if you have a girlfriend, make sure she’s happy with you.

For wanting herself.When she finally chooses her dreams, finally chooses herself and it doesn’t feel selfish. It feels like survival.

In this world, we need an ate like her, Dok Helena, and ate pharmacist who completely shows support no matter what her decisions, does not have malicious mindset and judgmental tendencies.

Sunshine's bravery for fighting for what she wants, her exercising her rights, and her choices are what young women of today should follow. It is important to see how women who plan to abort or did abort are NOT completely cruel nor sinners, as they also have a conscience and dilemma as they go through every consideration. Her conscience, being represented by ""bata,"" goes to show how she considered having her, but of course it all just boils down to her body, her choices, and her future. And the rights to have access in safe abortions does NOT only applies to rape victims but all WOMEN. ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE. AND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS HUMAN RIGHTS.

pelikuliara,10,"it's no surprise to me that a lot of filipinos will misunderstand the whole point and premise of this movie. ang pagb-buntis ng maaga ay madalas nakikita lamang bilang topic ng chismis ng marami kaya di na ko nagulat na madami ang di nakakaintindi sa istorya ni sunshine. i love the inclusion of mary grace in the story, it's a bleak reminder that the women who want and need to get abortions aren't always the stereotyped madonna who's into casual sex,(granted women shouldn't have to fit into a ""perfect victim"" image just to be granted bodily autonomy) but they are also minors who were victims of rape from family members. mary grace's story adds so much to how deeply the film tackles the conversation around abortion as well as making it known to the audience that abortion is not a black and white subject. additionally, it also does a good job in portraying the role of men in these women's lives as well as how little guilt they shoulder from something they also took part in. sobrang little ng guilt at remorse na nararamdaman nila miggy at yung tito ni mary grace. the fact that miggy was only able to help and apologize to sunshine when his father was involved was so putangina. if male audacity had a poster child it would be him. never fucking trust a man (period) who says his ""pull out"" game is strong, especially if that motherfucker is named miggy and talks like he consumes red pill content on the daily.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

What stays with you long after Sunshine ends is how the film treats every moment as something pulled straight from real Filipino girlhood. You see it in the small, mundane ways Sunshine tries to keep herself together like the way she tightens her jaw during training to hide the panic creeping up her spine, how she forces a neutral expression when adults around her throw judgment disguised as concern and the humiliation of realizing everyone expects her to handle a crisis she never chose.Girls grow up by being punished for becoming women. Sunshine is still a teenager, but the moment her pregnancy becomes known, people start talking to her like she owes them maturity, penance, and accountability she was never taught to carry.When Pastor Jaime steps in, offering moral pressure, you can feel the room closing in on her again.

haziah,10,"[ system log : 001 ]user : haziah | age : 23status : active // processingI liked Sunshine because it speaks volumes about the lack of real sex education among teenagers—how so many are left to navigate consequences without ever being given proper knowledge, guidance, or protection. It shows how quickly people are forced into rigid sides—pro-choice or pro-life—without being allowed the space to exist as confused, scared, and human first. I didn’t like it only because Maris Racal’s acting was phenomenal—raw, restrained, and painfully real—but because the film chose to center understanding instead of judgment. It didn’t sensationalize the situation; it made you sit with it.I liked it because it treated the experience as what it truly is: a life-altering moment that cannot be simplified into slogans, morals, or online arguments. It showed how heavy one decision can feel when the world is already crashing down on you. I liked it because it refuses to make the audience comfortable. It doesn’t beg for sympathy, it doesn’t chase approval, and it doesn’t try to make itself digestible for everyone.And most of all, I liked it because it never tells you what the “right” answer is. It simply lays everything bare and lets you face it on your own. It allows you to choose what to feel, what to believe, and what to carry after the credits roll.Some people say it lacked something—especially in its length—that it should’ve been longer, that it ended too soon. But I don’t agree. I think it had to end exactly where it did. Because some stories aren’t meant to be over-explained. Some experiences don’t offer neat closures. The ending didn’t feel incomplete to me—it felt honest.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

The talent of our Filipino directors, writers, and actors is flourishing; it just needs the right hand managing them. Studios surrounding Sunshine took a huge gamble promoting and marketing this movie, because they know how good it is. And it's that fcking good!Sunshine beautifully captures Sunshine, our protagonist, as she battles her way out of an unwanted pregnancy set in the cold city of Manila. This journey was documented with captivating visuals of Sunshine in the gym, in Quiapo, in a motel, etc. On top of this, this is unlike any other dialogue in mainstream Pinoy. The dialogue often has witty layers, purposeful intentions, and emotional punches.Maris Racal delivered a career-defining performance. This is not the same Maris Racal we often see in teleseryes or some other romcom movie. Her performance is an incredible take on such a complex and relatable character.I could nitpick some off details here and there which really bugged me, but I won't talk about it here as I believe that further magnifying this movie's success is what we should do.Sunshine represents every woman, every female, every girl, every lady of any shape or form. It brings up socially relevant topics and issues worthy of discussion. I am most impressed by its bravery to speak all about these, coming from a conservative country. Sunshine, the protagonist, showed bravery in confronting the stigma and the conservative norms.

The film explores the difficulties of finding the right medical care for abortion. Racal's performance is impressive, and she is solidly supported by Annika Co, Jennica Garcia, and Meryll Soriano.

yaampam,9,"The movie did not contain any surprise elements whatsoever — rather, it depicted the realities that Filipino women endure, especially when it comes to pregnancy and abortion. Seeing individuals like Sunshine and Mary Grace deal with the outcomes they did not choose is devastating. It's awful that they had to put their own lives in danger to reclaim their lives. In addition, I detest the notion that women are blamed and criticized while the majority of males who participated in the incident roam free from the consequences. It's horrible how obviously apparent the double standards are. Most of us are aware of the worst-case situations if abortion isn't legalized, and this film accurately depicts the gravity of the situation. If watching this doesn't change your mind about being anti-abortion, I don't know what will. Not everyone is ready to be a mother. Not everyone is capable of being a mother. Is protecting your child's future and safety truly a sin? I truly hope that this movie will continue to inspire empathy and provide better facilities for safe and regulated practices in the country.

Literal na daramdamin mo lang yung pelikula and your emotions will be enough for people to understand.Gets na gets ko si Sunshine—from thinking you’re an adult yet feeling like a child; an ambitious girl to a woman on a tightrope; from being alone and criticized by society as a whole to finding your space, your people, your support system despite what people have to say… and ultimately choosing your own peace and happiness—something that is deemed a privilege for women. Hindi naging madali ang pinagdaanan ni Sunshine at ng milyong-milyong babae sa Pilipinas, sa mundo. May mga babaeng katulad niya na hindi sinasadyang mabuntis, may mga babae namang katulad ni Menggay na posibleng ginahasa at pinagsamantalahan. Hindi ko masikmura kung gaano karaming babae ang dumadaan sa ganitong hirap araw-araw at nakakaramdam na wala na silang mapanghahawakan pa. At dadagdag pa sa pasakit ang ang mga lalaki, ang simbahan, gobyerno at mga sarado ang isip sa ganitong sitwasyon. Why is it that women have to suffer the consequences alone, with the whole world—heaven and hell—blaming them for what happened. A world that continues to place heavy pressure on a woman’s shoulders yet crucify them the moment they make a mistake. Society needs to be more forgiving to women who are trying their best to make and take up space without making them sacrifice their whole life and identity.

harrystylesock,,"SAGOT SA PELIKULANG “SUNSHINE”: HINDI GUGUSTUHIN NG BATA ANG MAMATAY SA ABORSYON KONTRA SA PINAKITA SA PELIKULA----------------------------Paalala: Ito ay dati naming Facebook post na muli naming inilabas dahil nasa Netflix na ang pelikulang ""Sunshine."" Para sa nagnanais na malaman kung sino ang ""unlikely guide"" sa caption, basahin ang post dito. ----------------------------Matapos maibalita ang pelikulang “Sunshine” ni Maris Racal, inaasahan ko na ang pagsuporta nito sa aborsyon o ang pagkitil sa anak na nasa sinapupunan ng kanyang ina. Ngunit, ang hindi ko inasahan ay ang huling parte ng pelikula. Hindi ko pinanood ang pelikulang ito ngunit nagbase ako sa buod nito upang malaman kung ano ang naganap [1].Si Sunshine (Maris Racal) ay naghahanda na sumali sa “gymnastics team” para sa Olympics ngunit nalaman niya na buntis pala siya. Dahil dito, pumunta siya sa Quiapo upang bumili ng pampalaglag. Matapos ng eksenang ito ay makikita na sinusundan siya ng isang batang babae. Iyon pala, ang babaeng ito, na nasa larawan sa post na ito, ay isang “imaginary friend” ni Sunshine. Hindi ko na babanggitin ang gitna ng buod ng kwento ngunit sa huling parte ng pelikula, makikita na si Sunshine ay naghahanda para sa Olympics. Nagpakita muli ang “imaginary friend” na batang babae kay Sunshine. Tinanong ni Sunshine kung nauunawaan ba ng batang babae ang desisyon niya. Matapos nito, pinakita ng batang babae na tinatanggap niya at niyakap niya na may luha sa mata si Sunshine. Ang “plot twist” dito ay ang “imaginary friend” na ito ay ang anak ni Sunshine na namatay dahil sa aborsyon. Sa imahinasyon ni Sunshine, tinanggap ng kanyang anak ang desisyon ni Sunshine na patayin siya sa sinapupunan. Tila ba tinuturo ng pelikulang ito, hindi lang na dapat gawing ligal ang pagpili ng tao na patayin ang anak sa sinapupunan ng ina, kundi gugustuhin ng isang bata na mamatay na lamang sa aborsyon kaysa ang mabuhay dahil sa benepisyo na matatanggap ng nanay kung pinatay na lang ang kanyang anak. Nakakalungkot dahil sobrang sama ng moralidad na ipinapalaganap ng pelikulang ito. Dahil dito, nais ko lang ipakita kung ano ang sinabi ng mga taong nakaligtas sa tangkang aborsyon. Hindi sa lahat ng pagkakataon ay namamatay ang mga anak na pinapalaglag. Dahil dito, mahalaga na makita ang kanilang perspektibo sa usapin ng aborsyon matapos silang makaligtas dito. Sabi ni Linda Swayn na nakaligtas sa aborsyon ngunit nagkaroon ng problema sa kanyang bungo dahil sa bawal na gamot na ginamit sa pampalaglag,""The greatest gift I have received is life. God has given me the greatest gift of life [2].""Ito naman ang mababasa sa buhay ni Charlie Rousseau, isang tagapagsalita sa radyo sa Canada, na nakaligtas ng aborsyon na nagdulot upang mabuhay siyang putol ang braso at dalawang binti,“She wants to continue with her dream to work and live remotely, and see the world [3].""Makikita naman natin na lagi nanaginip ng masama si Kimberly na maaaring parte ng kanyang masamang alaala sa tangkang pagpatay sa kanya,“For as long as I can remember, I would have a recurring nightmare. I could feel it coming, as if someone was coming to kill me... Somehow I knew it was going to kill me! It was terrifying! When I was 15 years old, I woke from the nightmare screaming and crying [4].""Ngayon, huwag muna natin isipin ang aborsyon kundi ang bagong silang na sanggol. Tama ba na patayin sila para hindi maapektuhan ang pangarap ng kanyang nanay? Sa tingin ba natin, sasabihin ng sanggol na tama ang desisyon ng kanyang ina na patayin siya? Malamang ay hindi. Ito rin ang ating rason sa pagtanggol sa buhay ng lahat, lalo na ng mga bata na walang kakayahan ipagtanggol ang kanilang sarili. Galing mismo sa boses ng mga nakaligtas ng aborsyon na alam nila kung gaano ito kasama at gaano kaganda ang buhay. Walang bata ang gugustuhin na sila ay patayin. Itigil na sana nila ang kasinungalingang ipinapalaganap sa pelikulang ito.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False
rysreviews1,10,"Bring back more filipino movies like this, gets ko sunshineSunshine really hits the mark in portraying toxic filipino culture (since we’re a largely catholic country, abortion is looked as “sinful” and “immoral”) and Filipino women struggles. We don’t even have access to safe abortion, even if the baby is born off of violence since it’s illegal. And it STILL is. Why is the concern of safety regarded for the unborn baby,, not the woman carrying it? Why are we shaming women for not wanting to keep it even if they didn’t ask for it? Kakainis. No more words other than thank you to Antoinette Jadaone for making a movie that tackles the pro-life/pro-choice conflict so well and shows awareness respectfully. Nailed it so hard. It’s uncomfortable to watch, but I can’t imagine the reality of living it.The movie leaving us with the question, are these beliefs that can be challenged more important to uphold than the safety of our Filipino women? How many more women must suffer until it gets through their thick skull that these beliefs and the anti-abortion law actively does more harm than good?Extra: I reco you read Nutribun review of this movie after you’ve watched it, explains it much better than me and i agreed with SO many points.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

The film captures that ache, the way society can be quick to moralize but slow to understand.For me, it felt like looking at a reflection of a system we’ve all quietly learned to navigate: the whispers, the shame, the institutions that pretend to help but rarely do. Yet in those heavy moments, you still see a girl trying to choose herself, even when the world insists she shouldn’t.it’s messy, raw, and painfully familiar… and that’s why it felt less like watching a film and more like remembering something you wish you could forget.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False

theironcolonel,9,"Sunshine offers a quiet yet affecting exploration of teenage pregnancy and abortion—two issues deeply intertwined with the social and economic realities of our country. What makes the film striking is its simplicity: it doesn’t rely on heavy dramatics, but instead allows its heartfelt moments and grounded storytelling to speak for themselves.I particularly appreciated how the film subtly incorporated supernatural elements. Rather than distracting from the story, these touches added depth and symbolism, making the film feel both intimate and introspective. It’s a creative choice that gives Sunshine a unique emotional texture.As someone who grew up Catholic, I’ve never taken a firm stance on abortion; I’ve mostly remained indifferent or unsure. But this film pushed me to reflect on the bigger picture. It gently raises a painful yet necessary question: Why bring a child into a country that struggles to provide a dignified, nurturing environment for its people? Without forcing a specific viewpoint, Sunshine invites viewers to confront the harsh realities that many young Filipinos face—stories that are often ignored or oversimplified.Overall, Sunshine succeeds not just as a piece of cinema, but as a conversation starter. It lingers with you, urging you to think about compassion, choice, and the societal conditions that shape both. It’s a simple film, but one with a resonance that’s hard to forget.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False

PRO-LIFERS.WOMEN'S RIGHTS SHOULDN’T BE SOMETHING TO BE DEBATED!“Hindi pa ako ready maging nanay” is already a valid reason for abortion. It’s her choice, not a moral issue for everyone to judge. Nakakalungkot noong ipinakita sa movie na ito kung gaano kalala ang situation sa public hospitals—kulang sa resources, walang safe at stigma-free options, mayroon pa ngang nanganganak na lang sa sahig dahil sa kakulangan sa mga tao at kagamitan. Kaya hindi nakapagtataka na for many women, the “safest” choice ends up being underground options, kahit sobrang risky. Mas ironic pa, kasi nasa paligid lang ng simbahan ang mga nagbebenta ng pamparegla, hilot, at kung anu-ano, tapos ang narrative ng church: “kung natukso ka, talo ka.” Kaya understandable that the “tukso” becomes sometimes the only lifeline for someone desperate. Women bear the brunt of the hypocrisy. That’s literally the only way a woman could access it. Hindi ko alam kung bakit kapag babae ka, ang daming bawal sa’yo. Pero hindi ka naman bibigyan ng reliable options. Napaka eye-opening nito sa atin, lalo na’t ipinakita sa atin na wala tayong karapatan husgahan ang batang ina kasi hindi natin alam ang pinagdadaanan nila.

julyuhna,8,"“Drown out the noise. You are Sunshine.”it’s heartbreaking how many young women are going through this right now. abortion in the Philippines is not only illegal, but also so deeply stigmatized that many are forced to carry this burden alone, sometimes risking their own lives through unsafe procedures. the film portrays this reality with such quiet honesty that it sticks with you. the symbolism throughout was also so striking, like the “Gift of God” sign in the jeepney Sunshine rode, or her so-called imaginary friend who could represent her unborn child or her inner child.it was honestly so satisfying watching her stand up for herself against miggy and his father, who’s a pastor. then of course, her breaking the bottle on tito bobot’s head? deserved. every mf like him deserves that.the final sequence felt incredibly freeing as well. it was like she was finally free, almost like a release of everything she had been carrying — fear, shame, pressure, expectation. her imaginary friend disappearing can be interpreted that she did push through with the abortion (which parallels the 13 y/o kid and ariana), or as her finally finding peace with whatever choice she made. hopefully, this film gives conservatives some perspective on the immense weight placed on women in these situations, and they’ll finally be able to say, “Gets ko na.” not everyone has the means to raise a child, especially when society is quick to judge. and even if you do have the means, you might simply not be ready because you might still have dreams you want to chase. it’s really tough, and that’s why kindness matters so much.at the end of the day, we shouldn’t be the ones deciding what women should do with their bodies. and yeah, practice safe sex!!",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

Pati 'yung sitwasyon na nangyayari sa mga public hospitals, 'yung mga facilities na binabayaran natin gamit ang tax natin, ay hindi nila magawang maayos. May mga doktor pang kung umasta ay hindi sila propesyonal at napaka-condescending. It is the reality of life here in the Philippines. Napansin ko rin that hatred for abortion is rooted from patriarchy and religion, napakahirap maging babae kapag ito ang mga kalaban mo, 'no? Sa babae ang sisi, sa babae ang lahat ng kasalanan habang ang mga lalaki ay may tinatawag na ""free pass."" Sabi pa nga nila, ""Ba't ka kasi bumubukaka,"" o kaya naman, ""Kung sino-sino na lang kasi ang kinakalantari mo."" Those things are the representation of the mindset of those who deem themselves as religious, but for me, they are just a bunch of hypocrites. Men can even be erased from the picture, and women will continue being condemned. Fuck people with double standards. Our society is so hypocrite that 'yung mga tinatawag na ""pamparegla"" ay natatagpuan malapit sa labas ng simbahan. Gaano sila kamapanghusga sa mga babaeng may karapatan sa kanilang sariling katawan, ipinapakita 'yan sa paniniwala nilang biased at outdated. It is sad to think na kailangan pa ng mga kababaihan na mag-lean towards these illegal means just to afford being free, when in the first place, it is their right to have a legal, safer, and non-demoralizing way to abort when it means taking care of their body, preventing the unborn from having a miserable life, and just letting women have their right to bodily autonomy. It just shows na napaka-patriarchal ng batas, sumabay pa 'yang pagiging misogynistic ng lipunang ginagalawan natin. These force women into motherhood and to have a life they do not want, and guess what happens after that? The cycle continues. Sa mga katulad ni Sunshine, at sa mga kababaihan, I'm proud of you.

Yet somehow, the film manages to confront its darkest truths while still carving out a sliver of hope. The performances are extraordinary—raw, fearless, and honest—but they make the film difficult to watch in the best possible way. It exposes how our country refuses to grow, medicine needed for the operation coming from black markets, how it continues to force women into roles far smaller than what they’re capable of, and how it avoids addressing issues that desperately need to be talked about. Women deserve choice. They deserve agency. They deserve that right without question.This film places you in the shoes of a woman who believes her life has been shattered by one reckless decision made by someone she trusted—and then shows, unflinchingly, how our society treats victims.Hopefully, the success of this film reignites the conversation around the importance of being pro-choice and pushes us toward building a better, more humane system.All we hope for is a little sunshine to finally break through.",2025-11-30,1,0,watch,True

baobeisaur,10,"this film doesn't just tell a story; it exposes a system. for that reason, it stands as one of the most important films ever made in the philippines. honestly, it deserves far more attention, discussion, and recognition. include it in school curriculums too if possible.you don't need tearful monologues, or dramatic breakdowns (not that there's anything wrong with them) to understand the full weight of sunshine's situation. the film uses restraint as its sharpest tool. the dim, muted visuals; the overwhelming noise of her environment; the way the camera locks her in the centre of the frame.. always boxed in, always between lines.. all emphasise how trapped she is by the social and religious stigma, and by a society that refuses to recognise abortion as a woman's right. the blurred backgrounds aren't just aesthetic; they reinforce her disconnection from the world around her. she doesn't have the luxury to care about anything beyond her immediate reality: herself, her dreams, and the looming consequences of every decision she faces.and that is the tragedy, sunshine is a young woman with ambition, yet she navigates a world that is unforgiving. she is asked to seek god's forgiveness for attempting to abort the baby, yet if god is understanding, wouldn't he understand that she is not ready, and that she acted out of necessity? with abortion vilified and access almost impossible, the film illustrates how society corners, isolates, and silences young mothers.. not with loud condemnation, but with quiet, crushing inevitability. it is a devastating portrait of how systemic and cultural forces conspire to limit women's autonomy, and a reminder of the human cost of denying choice.one of the most striking elements of the film, for me, is its gendered power dynamic. every character, without exception, imposes his own beliefs onto sunshine. urging her to keep the baby, citing legality, morality, or personal conviction. their ""advice"" is never about her well-being, it's about controlling her choices. the absence of a single moment where a man asks what she wants is not accidental, it reflects a broader social structure where women's autonomy is secondary to male authority.the women in the film, however, present a more nuanced spectrum. some internalise patriarchal norms and unintentionally reinforce them, but many others recognise sunshine's struggle immediately. they empathise not because they have the answers, but because they understand the emotional, economic, and social burden that falls disproportionately on women. their solidarity is quiet but powerful. a direct contrast to the coercive, dismissive tone of the male characters. the film ultimately critiques how systems built and upheld by men deny women agency, especially around reproductive choices. in a society where institutional and cultural norms consistently silence women, the film shows that women often became each other's only source of validation, understanding, and empowerment. no scene is waster. nothing is filler. every character is intentionally placed, each one shaping or limiting sunshine's decisions in ways that feel painfully real.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False

alberttseno,7,"Yes! This is the type of films the Philippines should make more! Finally a movie with substance, relevance, and courage to tell a story despite cultural taboo. This is required and essential.I thought an hour and a half wouldn’t be enough to dig deeper into the journey of Sunshine but it was actually just enough to see all of it. Although, there were unnecessary choices made in the film that I disliked and that I wish were done differently and I wish saw more of Sunshine’s character in the lowest of lows or maybe I’m just greedy. However,Maris Racal is a revelation. And for the Philippines to have such a film like this one that speaks to so many women, even men, in the country. I hope this is a step forward for the country to move progressively and this be a force for politicians to pass that bill. Because after all, films are made to speak out, protest, and to implement change. Lastly, Sunshine is such a huge step towards good filmmaking in the Philippines. We need more films that speak of truth and of society. Stories that need to be heard and not rely too much on fake romance. Though Sunshine isn’t perfect as a film itself, the courage and the amount of truth revealed in an hour and a half are enough to have the voices of so many women be heard.

MARIS RACAL I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR GAME!Ang kwento, ang cinematography, ang emosyon!!! Sobrang raw and realistic from the familiar “jeje” song playing sa jeep pagsakay ni Sunshine, to the 13 yr old na nakaranas ng pang aabuso mula sa kanyang tito (talamak ang kaso ng incest sa pinas, thank u direk for highlighting that). Sa sobrang realistic pati ang inis ko kuhang kuha ng conservative doctor. Literally had to pause and say “Putangina” pag sabing “Baka yan pala ang magiging future presidente ng Pilipinas or ang makakagamot sa AIDS.”Ang pelikulang ito ay napakatapang. It had the guts to shine a spotlight on a longstanding issue sa bansa na lagi na lang inooverlook. It dare call out and address what Filipinos considered as taboo. And as someone who had a debate with her mom over dinner about abortion, this film is so special to me. “Hindi ka ba kinikilabutan?” were my moms’ exact words but I cannot blame her. Being a country deeply rooted in Christianity, where morals and teachings of the church are deeply ingrained in you ever since you were young, it is actually hard to speak freely about this things without the catholic guilt creeping up on you. Kaya ang laki rin ng significance ng pagdasal muna ni Sunshine before nya gawin. To ask the lord for forgiveness.Plus it doesn’t shy away from showing the state of the country’s public healthcare system. Nakakaputangina lang. Putangina ng gobyerno. Putangina ng sistema kung saan kailangan maging life-threatening situation ang pagpapalaglag. Banning abortion does not end it, it only makes it unsafe for women since it causes them to resort to underground means. And what an irony that one of those means can be found tucked under the shadows of the church (mga ale na nagbebenta ng pamparegla, u carry so much hope for these women). The very church that condemns it and shuns women who will even consider it. This film is a big step in understanding women’s bodily autonomy. Mas mahalaga pa rin ang buhay ng nagdadalang-tao. Lastly, Annika (the child symbolizing Sunshine’s future child) saying “Gets ko na” at the end is so so dear huhu. Bata pa ang bata para magkabata. She has her whole life ahead of her and god forbid a woman chooses herself and her dreams. Gets ko na, Sunshine. Gets ko na.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

lyvady,10,"Hands down, wala akong masabi sa palabas na ‘to. This film reveals everything about the Philippines that we don’t often talk about. Many Filipinos have no choice kasi illegal ang abortion dito, and young women are forced into situations THEY NEVER REALLY WANTED. It shows the harsh reality of how society constantly pressures women into motherhood, ignoring their dreams, their health, and their right to make decisions about their own bodies. The film doesn’t sugarcoat the pain physical, emotional, and mental—that comes with being trapped in a system that refuses to acknowledge their autonomy.What hits the hardest is how normalized this struggle has become, and how many are suffering in silence. Especially the story of rhed bustamante’s character. Grabe. 13 years old nag cacarry na ng baby ☹️ a child carrying a child. This is a message to all the people to talk more openly about abortion, to stop victim-blaming, and to hold those useless shitty ass irresponsible men accountable. It’s more than a movie—it’s a wake-up call, a plea for empathy, and a DEMAND for change. Sobrang gets kita, sunshine.",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

amp_mf,10,"SUCH AN IMPORTANT FILM!!!!During these times, we genuinely need more films like this. First, not only does it touch on the struggles of a young woman faced with an unwanted pregnancy. It also shows how easy it is for the men to rid themselves of the responsibility. Miggy DID NOT give a fuck about Sunshine. He wanted her to deal with it herself; he wasn't even going to give her money if she didn't threaten him. It was his fault that she got pregnant, and yet she has to suffer the consequences of their unprotected sex, which he insisted upon. Second, it is very important how this film shows that early/childhood pregnancies are not just because of young people's 'kapabayaan.' More often than not, young girls' pregnancies are results of sexual assault and rape by predators. I cried when I saw Mary Grace, even more when we were told she's just 13. JUST 13!!!!! She wasn't ""wreckless,"" she wasn't out there having sex with anyone; she was raped by her own uncle. And she's just expected to mother the child born out of such a horrific thing done to her?Third, it shows you just how important legalizing abortion is. It's already happening out there. People are selling abortive pills or concoctions. People are doing basement abortions, in unsafe conditions, without licensed doctors. It's happening and it's dangerous. Sunshine was hospitalized. Mary Grace almost died. If abortion was legal, none of this would've happened. These girls would've been safe and cared for.Again, what an important film! It also shows how abysmal the healthcare system is in the Philippines. Overcrowded hospitals, little to no financial support, etc.On top of that, phenomenal performances all around. Maris Racal was great. Jennica Garcia was, as usual, brilliant. Rhed Bustamante, you will always be a star.This might be the longest entry in my letterboxd rn.

astrocampo,8,"One thing I like about Sunshine is its brazen risk to center the story on a 19-year old who's made consequentially irresponsible choices. It's a gambit that can easily be -- and, judging by discussions surrounding this movie, has already been -- misconstrued as a lesson on the importance of hammering down our society's puritanical views on sex and reproductive health to set teenage girls straight. That, somehow, Sunshine is a lesson in, as the elders say, ""opening your legs for just about anybody""; that she did not listen to the adage is an absolute failing on her part, and its consequences fall rightfully on her shoulders. But here's the tricky bit: Sunshine could very well have been about a mother who could no longer give birth to another, and it would have still been met with the same logic-defying resistance that still places the blame squarely on the woman. Minor gripes include a finicky plot device that, at times, feels jarring and slightly questionable in terms of messaging. But it all feels egregious to say because the urgency of its existence really dwarfs over whatever minor flaws it may have. It also helps that Sunshine carried is so deftly by Maris Racal's and Jennica Garcia's career-defining performances, and a score by Rico Blanco that knows how to restrain and reintroduce itself in all the right moments.Sunshine cracks open a conversation on an obstinately immovable subject, and unflinchingly exposes the grim reality on how our women and girls move about our society, bearing the problems that we could easily find solutions to but which our religious guilt and intolerance constantly shame us into denying.",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

labbly,9,"This is such a wake-up call about how dangerous abortion can be when it’s not done safely. That’s why we really need to legalize abortion, so women can have the option and so it can be done medically and safely. It’s funny how all the men in the movie reflect real life, where they don’t have a fucking ounce of understanding about women’s reproductive health. This also reflects how men often dictate the legalization of abortion when they shouldn’t, because they don’t even have a fucking UTERUS!Also, fuck that old doctor. Holier-than-thou people are the most hypocritical pieces of shit. Instead of empathizing with Sunshine, she had the audacity to take the religious route.The storyline of the thirteen-year-old also shows that people should not have a child if they cannot fucking provide and protect. It reflects our current society especially the poor children whose parents are pieces of shit. And that’s exactly why abortion should be legalized so women can have the option if they are not ready. Just look at her life; she was born to a mother who doesn’t care and a rapist uncle who should be imprison.Why the fuck is the Philippines so backward? Fuck all the corrupt politicians. Also, what the fuck was that male doctor doing denying care to a child whose life was at stake because of the abortion? Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t think that happens in real life. Doctors should save a patient regardless of whether it was due to an abortion, especially when the patient is critical.

lustcry,10,"the premise alone is enough for me to give it a full rating. to come up with a movie about one of the most taboo topics in this predominantly catholic country—given how conservative almost everyone is about it, how it’s actively vilified and condemned, how those who seek it are treated as no better than murderers, and how women are left to fend for themselves and look for alternative ways, whether through an underground clinic, safe or unsafe, or a seller’s comforting words when you don’t even know if the medicine will work—is a huge feat. it has been long overdue, but this is already a big step for everyone. abortion is, and will always be, healthcare.film-wise though, i absolutely LOVE the color grading. i usually hate SOME filipino movies (omg i’m sorryyyy) because the coloring pisses me off (like ik we can do better). idk how to pinpoint what gives me the ick but,,, yeah. sunshine’s though was nice. and it was a delight to see bits of manila’s vibe. always shady, dirty, BUT well, that’s our country and i loved the actual showcase of it. there were some symbolism and stills of how ironic some scenes can be too!! nice touch :) from the pills next to the statues to the jeepney signs. the plot is predictable for me (re: what those kids are), but not in a bad way. it just shows that it’s working, and i feel seen. a lot of women will feel seen. not saying we went through the exact same thing, but generally, the gist of thinking your life is over, or will be if it does happen, because we don’t have a choice in the first place, and are expected to just live with it, is familiar. the amount of mental gymnastics people will spew about “the future of the children,” how they could be “the next inventor of a cure,” while never considering the mother, who has her own ambitions, who has to give birth, raise the child, and provide the system and support for their hypothesis to even happen… it’s all broken-record arguments. these are the usual lines they’ll say, and some of their reactions (doctors, friends, “partners”) really DO HAPPEN irl and it’s proof that the film is heavily based from real experiences, and well researched enough about the actual process people will go through (and went through) for this. here’s to shed light, to inform, and hopefully, to make people more open, thoughtful, and willing to give women the autonomy they deserve.mic drop",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

chocopaolover,8,"if there is light, kahit konting-konti lang, we chase it—because sometimes that’s the only thing left for women to hold.sunshine (2025) is the kind of film na hindi ka pinapa-wow sa effects or spectacle. instead, it sits beside you quietly, like a friend na alam lahat ng pagod mo kahit hindi mo sinabi. it’s woman-centered in the most unsettling, honest way—walang sugarcoating, walang mythologizing, just the raw truth of being a girl in a country that asks you to endure more than it ever protects.the film strips away the usual softness associated with its title. sunshine isn’t light; she’s a girl trying to survive a world that keeps dimming her. and when the story touches the issue of abortion not being legalized in the Philippines, it doesn’t sensationalize it—pinapakita lang niya ‘yung totoo: na in this country, women are expected to carry consequences alone. that reproductive rights become moral battles instead of health and safety; na the system treats our pain like an inconvenience, our choices like crimes.‘yung internal struggle ni Sunshine—‘yung fear, guilt, confusion, desperation—hindi dahil “mahina siya,” but because society makes women feel cornered by circumstances we never chose. and the film doesn’t villainize her for thinking about her future; it villainizes the world that forces her to justify wanting one.and then there’s Miggy.Miggy is… familiar. not evil, not abusive, just painfully typical. he represents the kind of boyfriend most girls in the philippines know too well—the one who “cares,” but only until it requires accountability. the boy who says “I’m here for you” pero umiilag sa big conversations. the boy who loves you but doesn’t understand the weight you carry because he’s never had to carry anything like it.Miggy is the embodiment of how boys in this country are raised: may freedom without consequence, may opinion without knowledge, may presence without responsibility. his reactions, his avoidance, even his attempts to comfort—they feel real because they’re exactly what so many girls have lived through. boys who think support is just saying “kaya natin ’to” while leaving the actual pain to us.sunshine 2025 becomes a commentary on how women are taught to be accountable for everything—including mistakes that weren’t only theirs—while men are taught to be forgiven for everything. the movie doesn’t hate Miggy; it exposes him. it shows the casualness of male privilege, the way it slips into daily life unnoticed but heavy—always heavy—on our side.and that’s what makes the film hit: it’s not loud, not preachy, not dramatic. it just shows the truth—and the truth is already loud enough.sunshine isn’t a story about brightness; it’s a story about women trying to navigate a world that refuses to make space for their choices, their fears, their bodies, their futures. it’s a film that says:the pain wasn’t yours alone, but somehow, you were the only one expected to carry it.and long after the credits, you’re left with that hurt—the kind that reminds you why we keep fighting for a world where women don’t have to beg for the right to their own lives.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,True

benazapril,10,"Sunshine (2024) is the most needed Filipino film of our generation and the generations to come. Beyond the excellent storytelling and technicalities, the message it conveys in a predominantly Catholic & conservative country is a long-overdue revelation of the reality of women.The film opens conversations for the uncomfortable truth of human nature. This is not just Sunshine's story. This is also the story of every woman and every young girl who face the challenges of being silenced and whose rights are being dictated and stepped on by our society.Maris perfectly portrayed Sunshine as a woman who knows what she wants and realizes the power that she and every other woman should have.The rest of the cast realistically depicted the Filipino society that reflects their morals on the teachings of Christianity. Moreover, the two ""imaginary"" characters brought life to the film by displaying the faces behind the masked moralities our society tells us.As a child of unwanted birth and as an adoptee, I know deep in my heart how much I advocate for abortion. I will always side with what is just and right; the ability of women to have access to reproductive health and the power of women to make decisions for their own life.Maraming salamat sa tapang at galing mo, Direk Tonet.",2025-11-29,1,0,watch,True

(but obviously i still do watch movies beyond my age rating) The overbearing nature of religion is truly a problem in the philippines; and among our people, the vast majority of our country is made up of catholics, and it seems like the state is sometimes one with the church because of that fact.

akoetry,10,"Authentic depiction of how the female reproductive health is viewed and discussed in the Philippines. It is terrifying and undeniably demeaning that many, if not all, do not have access to these basic rights and thus continue to endanger the lives of many women out there. It is more infuriating to know that this also includes children as young as 13. Though this inclusion in the film may seem minor, it actually emphasizes that not being able to be given a choice to our own body steals our futures away.I also liked the nuances and subtle details that made this film feel more humane and relatable, including the motto etched on the Jeepney Sunshine rode when she found out she was pregnant, which was “GIFT OF GOD.” Hands down, Maris Rascal nailed this role.

Ito ay realidad na ang batas sa bansang ito ay nakaka apekto sa pag lilingkod kapwa. Ang ate ni Sunshine na inintindi at sinuportohan hindi lamang ang desisyon kundi ang pangarap ni Sunshine.

camiiberry,9,"Grabe napaiyak naman ako nito. Although I have personal reservations about Maris Racal due to past issues, her performance in this film was undeniably amazing. Sunshine is a definite eye-opener regarding religion, stigma, and the taboo surrounding abortion matters here in the Philippines.I genuinely feel for all the women represented by the characters of Sunshine and Rhed. They may have different names, but they share a rough, unfair path: being stigmatized and pressured to conform to religious and misogynistic beliefs about motherhood. They are forced into the role of nurturing a child, often without considering their own agency.I particularly noticed the scene when Miggy and his father confronted Sunshine about her situation. They never once asked her what she wanted. Their ""plans"" were simply laid out for her to accept without a word, effectively depriving her of choice. This lack of genuine care is what hurts. Furthermore, the film shows how these women are forced to go through dangerous and unhygienic lengths just to pursue their personal dreams, highlighting how their rights as human beings are limited solely because of their CHOICE.I appreciate this film immensely, and it should be talked about more. The tragic reality of Rhed’s character, a 13-year-old victim raped and impregnated by her own uncle, is a situation faced by many. Yet, victims like her are still discriminated against for wanting an abortion. The movie effectively represents this toxicity, such as the scene where the OB-GYN cruelly orders a literally pale and blue Sunshine to ""repent"" while she is struggling in a hospital bed.This film is beautifully made. I sincerely hope that someday, people will truly receive the message: Every woman should have a choice. Depriving them of that fundamental choice does NOT make one a saint.",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

This kind of shit is barbaric and has no place in the current state of the world. The ending was very powerful.

jelieloop,10,"Gets ko si Sunshine.This film really captures me the most. As a woman who grew up in a most conservative country and a religious family, I feel the comfort of the movie. I know that tackling this kind of topic would raise brows to the people especially the one who’s spirituality believes that a women shouldn’t undergo abortion even if she really didn’t want to bear the child. Actually, it’s even funnier that this country preach that abortion should ban but the truth is there is a lack of education about sex, abortion, and contraceptives. Additionally, it’s so hypocrisy and misogynistic that people really blame woman for getting pregnant but NOT THE MAN?! In fact, they are the ones who put babies inside the woman’s womb. I really learned so many lessons in the movie which open my mind to the struggles of a woman. It’s disappointing that people keep preaching what’s right or wrong but THEY NEVER HELP AND UNDERSTAND THESE WOMEN. The movie open my mind that abortion SHOULD BE LEGALIZE. Abortion ISN’T a sin, murder, nor crime. IT’S A HEALTH CARE. It’s NOT selfish. It’s okay.But it is just sad that the Philippines is not yet ready to understand and tackle this kind of topic. I get Sunshine. The guilt-tripping, shame, and misogyny are tackled in a best possible way to give the viewers assurance and comfort. Also, it gives reminder that Filipinos should really open their minds and change their mindset. Women didn’t deserve the shame, the hate, and mostly the expectations that have been throwing to them just because THEY ARE WOMEN. For fucking sake. WOMEN NEED SUPPORT NOT A FUCKING JUDGEMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO’S CLAIMING TO BE A SPIRITUALLY ACTIVE BUT CANNOT OPEN THEIR MINDS AND THINK RIGHT.I hope and wish that the government legalize abortion. It is not a shameful thing to do. It is not killing. It is a self-care — A HEALTH CARE. People should know and understand that.Overall, I really love the movie and it will have a special place in my heart.

This movie is so impactful, and it felt surreal as it is totally happening in this country right now. Kuhang kuha yung reyalidad sa bawat buhay ng mga Pilipino, sa mga babaeng pinagkaitan ng sariling desisyon sa kanilang sariling mga katawan. As a person who agrees about legalising abortion in this country/pro choice, the religious people who tried to convince Shine and even made her feel guilty about aborting her baby triggered me so much. Dahil lamang sa relihiyosong paniniwala, o konsensya? I get it, it is a sin and it is evil thing to do. But what's more evil is that producing an unwanted child out of guilt into this world. Sunshine wasn't ready to be a mother, she still has dreams to follow, and she has the right to make a decision for her own life, own good, and own satisfaction. Miggy didn't even felt responsible for that child. He only got scared of his pastor father who is also a manipulative religious man. Smh. Men will be a horndog and disappear, yet it's their sperm that made that baby. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Yes, raw sex is pleasuring. But the thought or risk of producing a child habang hindi ka pa handa maging magulang ay dapat lamang na mas nangingibabaw sa kagustuhan mong masatisfy sexually. I hope people are aware of the consequences of their action before doing something because it's a big responsibility.I love this movie so much. Grabe kuhang kuha lahat, mga kaganapan sa maynila, mga black market, mga bawat sulok o tindahan sa quiapo, mga taong hindi nauubusan ng pag asa mabuhay sa kabila ng kahirapan ng buhay, mga batang kalye na nangangarap, at ang mga kinabukasan na naghihintay para sa kanila.I had goosebumps about Annika's representation in the movie. I thought she was the younger Sunshine 😭 I just realized that she's the child that shine could've had. Now I know why she always appears around her, and make her feel guilty, and understood her in the end.I love this movie so much! I hope this will be an eye opener to those imbecile peeps lol, and ofc the government. Abortion should be legal, especially if it'll be processed by the law too. Irresponsible people should not be punished by forcing them to keep the child. Because only the child will suffer throughout their lives. There are for sure a lot of an unwanted pregnancies situation, not only by not using condom but could be also by a failed contraceptives, or lack of knowledge about the reproductive system. Restricting abortion doesn't really promote responsibility—it just punished people for circumstances that are often beyond their control, and women will always be left with no choice but to abort an unwanted child in a harmful way.",2025-11-29,6,0,watch,True

The movie doesn’t shy away from the reality na hanggang ngayon, ang hirap mag-access ng abortion services sa Pilipinas dahil illegal pa rin ito.

nikhil1979,9,"A young aspiring teenage Filipino gymnast who everyone looks up to has been selected in the National team to participate in Olympics. Her nightmare begins when she finds out she is pregnant. Her boyfriend wants her to abort. Her best friend disowns her. She hallucinates a small girl chasing her around trying to make her feel guilty. Desperate to pursue her gymnastics career, she buys a product from the local black market. She rents a room in a shady inn, inserts the product and ends up bleeding profusely. She wakes up in an anti abortion clinic to learn that the fetus is still alive. ‘Sunshine’ plays out like a horror movie as the characters try to come to terms with their reality. The tension, fear and desperation is palpable. Sunshine’s journey from numb helplessness to a woman who wants to pursue her dreams is truly remarkable.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines under all circumstances, including rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk. Black markets of abortifacients thrive near places of worship and street side shops. Hospitals refuse admission and doctors perform secret illegal procedures. Antoinette Jadone’s writing and direction is raw and brutal. The narrative is neither preachy nor claims to know a solution to a complex problem that leaves women without agency. It simply critiques the situation and demands that viewers confront it along with women who are left helpless in front of politics and religion.

The film that shows how the Philippines lack support for its beautiful and brave women.Una sa lahat, fuck quiapo air. Quiapo—ang baho, ang sikip, ang init! Pero Quiapo… a place where you’ll find even the tiniest bit of hope, a place where even an ounce of solution can be found, a place where help exists, even if only through a few people.i also loved how fuckass men were portrayed in this movie. walang kwentang jowa, walang kwentang kapatid, walang kwentang tatay, walang kwentang tito, walang kwentang doktor. Tangina ang may kwentang lalaki lang ata rito is yung tricycle driver eh. Tangina ng mga lalaking ganyan. Patriarchy at its finest! Also, fuck women who let themselves be abused by this power. Yes, I’m talking about YOU nanay ni Mary Grace.as it progressed, onti-onti kong nararamdaman yung emotional sincerity ng film. yung dilemmas of decisions ni sunshine and yung heartbreaking truth about Mary Grace’s pregnancy. 13 years old pa lang siya? Yes, 13 years old pa lang siya. The movie refuses to romanticize their situation. instead, it leans into the uncomfortable truths of being a young woman in a society that praises discipline, resilience, and sacrifice yet offers little support when life derails. Director Jadaone shapes the film with a raw, documentary-like honesty: tight shots of silent breakdowns, stripped-down scenes with no dramatic score, and a narrative that mirrors the suffocating pressure placed on young Filipinas navigating taboo choices.Lastly, ang nagustuhan ko talaga sa film na to is the fact na the film didn’t fail to show and acknowledge the other women surrounding sunshine. women who, though not always in the spotlight, embody the many forms of pressure, expectation, and silent resilience that shape the world she moves in. they all carry their own versions of sacrifice: women praised for being disciplined, nurturing, and endlessly strong, yet rarely offered the same support they tirelessly give. like seriously? the maternity ward scene broke my heart so much 💔 seeing allthe women sharing the same beds also shows how fucked up our healthcare system really is. Tayo-tayo lang rin nagtutulungan. Tayo lang ang sumusuporta sa isa’t isa. Tayo lang mga babae. Kudos to that tindera. Ironic lang na sa harap pa talaga ng mga rebulto ni santo niño nagtinda ng pampalaglag 🤍 these kinds of religious beliefs shouldn’t really hinder us from doing what’s right and best for ourselves. and in showing these women’s quiet struggles, the film expands its emotional weight, reminding us that the story isn’t just about one girl’s burden but about an entire generation of women expected to endure everything while being thanked for it in silence. kulang pa tayo sa pansin, sa pagmamahal, at sa suporta. i hope that someday, all of us can finally feel how to live as a woman and be loved as a woman.",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

Love the irony, the symbolism, and the heats.But then again, they be trying to highlight everything all at once but failed to deliver why we’re here in the first place. It was moving, as a woman. BUT AS A WOMAN I was hoping for a more impactful message since it opened a lot of discourse. Women are far more complex and I was looking for chaos in what a woman feels in a society where everyone are so entitled to decide on how a woman should act and carry themselves. The movie could’ve gone deeper, one that touches diff range of emotions. It just doesn’t feel genuine, yk.Overall, Im giving it 4 stars.

samdotmov,8,"Kudos to Direk Tonet, Maris Racal, and the whole team responsible for creating this film, thank you for being brave and casting a light on our nation’s issues often overlooked in fear of the cultural taboo it carries. I would have rated it 5 stars, but the choice to represent Sunshine’s internal conflict with herself through a hallucinated child character doesn’t sit right with me. Jadaone’s direction results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as a bold attempt at cinematic expression to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, frames it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. Though, I will still give my flowers to this movie. It helped brought upon a conversation in our country long overdue and for that I am grateful. I hope it inspires other filmmakers to be bold in the face of a country that chooses to be blind to issues that continue to grow with no solutions in sight.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,False

hellojaaack,10,"people often judge teenage pregnancy as the result of “giving in to temptation,” but this film shows the other side—not all teenage pregnancies are wanted or chosen. what i love about the film is how powerful it is; it resonates deeply with viewers and delivers a clear message consistently from start to finish.maraming sunshine sa lipunan—na biglaan, takot, at walang lakas ng loob na harapin ang pagiging ina—pero hindi ito usapin na masama ng tao si sunshine kaagad nang dahil lamang sa hindi pa siya handa. a moment of temptation is not enough reason to demand she accept her situation, as forcing a woman into parenthood before she is ready is a far greater mistake.i hope this film opens more eyes and highlights the need to strengthen reproductive rights in our country, recognizing that abortion is a right for all women. men who cause pregnancies rarely face the same scrutiny or shame; women, on the other hand, bear society’s judgment alone.abortion is not always chosen for pleasure—often it is the result of abuse or exploitation.it is heartbreaking that in the philippines, a case of violence against women is reported every 57 minutes. globally, over 30% of women—more than 737 million—experience abuse from partners or non-partners. many feel trapped, unable to leave because they are pregnant and have no right to terminate.in february 2024, save the children urged stronger reproductive rights in the philippines, noting that 35% of filipino girls under 15 became pregnant from 2021 to 2022—clear victims of abuse and exploitation. this is a critical issue that the government must address.women have the right to control their own bodies and make their own choices—regardless of religion, culture, or social pressure. they are often the most vulnerable and left behind in such situations.thank you to sunshine for her courage in standing up for herself and pursuing her dreams, and thank you to the film for portraying these realities.as i read somewhere, “marami ang hindi mapapatawad si sunshine dahil sa ginawa niya, pero sapat naman nang napatawad ni sunshine ang sarili niya.”",2025-11-29,1,0,watch,True

Patriarchy is relentless : they leave it up to the women to pick up the pieces that the men shattered— ""Bahala ka na diyan, just get rid of it"". Maris Racal’s performance was exquisite, ramdam mo yung pagod, sakit, and overwhelming suffocation that Sunshine faces as she navigates through making a choice that is supposed to be hers and hers alone. Every flip, every landing, every stretch was a step towards her dreams— the stage, the recognition, the life she has ever envisioned for so long. Sunshine’s journey is not just about survival; it’s about the courage to continue dreaming in a world determined to limit her. Gymnastics wasn’t more than a sport, it was her identity, her sanctuary, the place that gave her hope to keep believing.

ratedj,8,"the moment i realized they brought the kids to life…. amazing conceptalthough they show the potential of what their kids could have been or who they could have become, and it hurts to take it away, the current lives of the mothers also have to be considered. they also have dreams to fulfill. taking away their future also means taking away the future of their children. both are really big factors to take in, but what truly matters is knowing what needs to be done today for a better tomorrow.so if you’re asking me, the real selfishness here is doing what is deemed right by society just because they don’t realize how selfish bringing a life to a world that isn’t ready for you is. it’s simple. they’re not ready, and that should be a good enough reason.and the way this was written and directed by a filipino woman is really brave storytelling. i loved it. i hope more close minded people watch this. this should be shown in catholic schools. sorry papa G, pero gets ko rin si Sunshine!",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,False

jolsf,10,"First of all, I know that this movie premiered at the 49th Toronto International Film Festival in 2024 and arrived in Philippine cinemas 4 months ago. And now that it finally dropped on Netflix… I hope I’m not too late to say it finally: This movie is powerful 😭💯Antoinette Jadaone delivers one of her most fearless films yet with ‘𝗦𝘂𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲’ — a coming-of-age sports drama that hits with quiet power and emotional honesty.Maris Racal plays the titular character, a young gymnast on the road to the Olympics. Her world revolves around discipline, repetition, and the dream of making it to the competition she’s trained her whole life for. But when she discovers she’s pregnant, her perfectly controlled world cracks open.What I loved about the film is how it never sensationalizes her situation. Sunshine’s fear is treated with quiet realism. The movie acknowledges how complicated teenage pregnancy is, especially in a society where abortion, reproductive rights, and bodily autonomy remain heavily stigmatized and often misunderstood.These themes are controversial. And yes, the movie will divide people. But ‘𝗦𝘂𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲’ refuses to look away from the truth: 𝘔𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘍𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘱𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘴 𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘦 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘨𝘨𝘭𝘦𝘴 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦. 𝘈𝘯𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘺 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘷𝘦 𝘦𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘵𝘩𝘺, 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘫𝘶𝘥𝘨𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵.Maris is phenomenal here. She carries the entire emotional weight of the story with a performance that feels painfully real. She rarely breaks down on screen, but you think her internal collapse in the smallest expressions — the breath she holds, the way she avoids eye contact, the way she pushes her dream forward while everything else is falling apart.𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲.The supporting cast — particularly Jennica Garcia, Meryll Soriano, Rhed Bustamante, and Xyriel Manabat — also elevate the film, each representing a different kind of pressure or support Sunshine faces. And yeah, some male characters in the movie definitely got what they deserved. 😅Jadaone’s direction is quiet, patient, and uncomfortably close — exactly how it should be. The movie lets us follow Sunshine’s anxiety and feel the suffocating pressure she’s under.One of the film’s boldest artistic choices is the recurring appearance of a mysterious girl who seems to follow Sunshine. At first it’s confusing, then a bit eerie, then surprisingly emotional. I won’t spoil anything, but when the film finally reveals who she represents… 😭. It’s symbolic, heartbreaking, and adds a deeper emotional layer to Sunshine’s arc.Beyond the gymnastics, beyond the controversy, Sunshine is really about choice — and how young women often aren’t given the space to empower themselves to make their own choices.The movie conveys important messages: your body is your own; silence can mask the deepest struggles; the pressure to be perfect is harmful; pursuing dreams matters, but so is ensuring one's survival; kindness fosters safety, while judgment breeds fear; and young women need safe spaces. The movie doesn’t push a specific viewpoint — it drives for humanity.Overall, ‘𝗦𝘂𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲’ is brave, heartbreaking, and painfully relevant. It does not shout — it whispers truths that hit even harder. Indeed, it’s a film that mirrors reality for many young women today, and one that our society needs to see, even if the conversations it starts are uncomfortable.With that being said, I’m going to give this movie…9/10! ⭐️ (Woooo!)",2025-11-26,1,0,watch,True

mvnci,9,"Where Filipino films trend to historic dramas and at times big explosive bursts of emotion, Sunshine reflects the good and the ugly of Filipino society in the modern times. It is within the same type as the classics like Maynila sa Mga Kuko ng Liwanag, but where it could've easily just copied that same old formula of poverty, crime, and the ugliness that lies beneath the city, the film chooses to explore controversial topics at its heart and anchors it toward really good character dynamics, not to mention where other films center around a male character from the rural side or from the slums, we instead focus on a lady who is faced with a great moral dilemma (in the Filipino perspective, you'll get it) when her dreams are on the verge of being stripped away from her. While watching, I sometimes forget that it is a Filipino film (not to sound derogatory or self-hating btw) because it strays away from tired old cliches other Filipino films do, and while the blueprints of those tropes are present, they are presented in a light that feels more subdued than its usual contemporaries. Also, I do love how the film does respect the audience in choosing not to explain certain things, letting us fill in the gaps.It's a great watch, in my opinion. And I feel that this film should be at the helm of some sort of renaissance for Philippine cinema, where we aren't afraid to speak out and be bold while also making great art out of it.",2025-11-29,3,0,watch,True

Some experience it as the consequences of their actions, but this movie also gives up a glimpse of those who are oppressed and have nowhere to go.

jmosatalla14,8,"What will you do if your dream is at stake because of one mistake?Sunshine delivers a powerful message about reproductive rights and the need for access to safe and legal abortion.The film shows the current state of healthcare in the Philippines and how this basic necessity has become inaccessible, especially to those living below the poverty line.I like how the film does not romanticize the societal issue of unwanted pregnancy. Instead, it highlights how stigma deeply affects women’s decision-making about their own bodies. It shows how the main character struggles with an internal conflict and debates with her own conscience.While the film clearly presents why abortion should be legalized and recognized as part of healthcare in the Philippines, it also portrays how religion and health often clash. It is true that our country is still in the process of accepting that abortion is a right that should be available to all women.Some might argue that safe sex is the only way to avoid these situations, but we cannot ignore the fact that many women experience sexual abuse, rape, or non-consensual ejaculation during intercourse.Sunshine is not just a film that explains why safe abortion should be legalized; it calls our attention to consider the issue without guilt-tripping women through religion or societal pressure.Women should have the freedom to decide what to do with their own bodies. Marriage or co-parenting should not be treated as a band-aid solution to a lifelong responsibility. These solutions do not apply to everyone, especially to those who do not have the means to support a child.I know we all have different perspectives on this issue, but thinking long-term about the future of our children depends on how ready we truly are to take on this responsibility.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,False

cas_siana,10,"Love how the film depicts the harsh reality of what women have to go through just to be able to decide for themselves and their BODIES!! This movie really goes to show how making abortion illegal makes it so much harder and dangerous for women. It does not sanctify the value of life since in the first place the life of the woman is endangered. Moreover, I love how Manila gets depicted in this light, it shows the good and bad that comes with the city. It is bad for obvious reasons, the normalized chaos that is happening around it, how every night Sunshine is there, a mayhem ensues. However, I appreciate how Manila became a sanctuary place for her, where we can see how despite the chaos that happens every night, there are bits of humanity that saves her. The girl dun sa hotel, yung tricycle driver, and the 13-year-old girl that she met.Furthermore, I would like to commend the addition of having childrens act as her conscience or the ""what if child of hers"". It's a great addition because we can see how in the beginning of the film the girl was literally shouting ""murderer"" over and over again because in her perspective, her mother is harming her. But in the end when she said ""gets ko na"", it became a cathartic scene as it finally hits us that it isn't about being irresponsible and selfish ---- rather it is something more than that. The whole line of the girl saying to her friend Ariana that her dream is the same as Sunshine's is a great addition because I think it rings true with reality. As every now and then, when a child hears about the dreams of their parents and how they had to stop it to take care of their children, especially when it comes to Mothers, the child often feels bad and just wished that thier Mom was able to live out their dream first.Lastly, I love the relationship of sunshine and her older sister, the fact that never once pinagalitan o diniktahan ng ate nya sa kung paano nya haharapin yung sitwasyon niya goes to show how much she trusts and love Sunshine. I also love the contrast that all throughout the film there were different sides of the story whether labelling her as a ""murderer"" o miggy telling her to do what you got to do that once you reached the end scene when her sister just told her ""kahit ano maging desisyon mo kampi lang ako sayo"" made it soo impactful. Kase in the end yun lang naman ang kailangan niyang marinig, we have seen her face through that circumstance alone with nothing but her conscience, that the moment na sinabi sa kanya yun, it became a relief to her as well as allowed her to finally tell someone or at least cried it out to them na natatakot din siya kase nga bata din siyaa and hindi pa siya ready maging nanay. All in all, the film was a 10 out of 10, and I appreciate how the film wasn't all in the face about what you should believe in and what you shouldn't. It just presents Sunshine's story and her decision which should be acknowledged because hindi dapat humantong sa isang sitwasyon na mas uunahin pa ng isang doktor ang kaniyang lisensya kesa sa buhay ng isang tao dahil lang ""nagpalaglag"" siya. If you really value life in its essence then we should also acknowledge the life of the person carrying the baby so bakit niyo papabayaan lang na mamatay yung batang 13-year-old???????? so in conclusion:TANGINAA NG MGA LALAKETANGINA MO MIGGYTANGINA NUNG DOKTORATANGINA NUNG LALAKING DOKTORTANGINA NUNG TITO TANGNIA NUNG WALANG KWENTANG NANAY (?) - di nya deserve matawag na nanay",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,True

jystique,10,"Holy shit, this film had me in tears. Not only is it extremely well made, the cinematography and the characters were so raw that it had me stressing over them. I have never rooted for anyone so much to get rid of that damn baby. The movie also shows the darkest sides of the healthcare system in the Philippines, religion, and most of all, fucking men. It is unfortunate that us Filipina women have it the fucking worst. Not only are we in a third world country where it is illegal to abort, but we are guilt tripped over and over again by society to not choose ourselves. We are literal machines for them to procreate and forget ourselves in the process. We are not human to them.Right from the get-go it is shown how unprepared (who I assumed is 20) 20 year old Sunshine is. Even when she is cleaning up her sister’s child, she raises her hand as if to scare the child, when the child clearly does not understand this gesture. The men in this film are shown to be no help at all, may it be sibling, the boyfriend, the men in the streets, every. single. man. The concept of birthing a child will never be their problem, it will never even cross their minds. I love how realistic the scenes were when all the pregnant were all together, aiding each other and comforting each other; that is the harsh truth— men will never know the connection us women have with one another. Even if they are strangers.Rhed (Mary Grace) is the exact reason why abortion should be legalized in the Philippines. Young women subject themselves to improper medical procedures because that’s all they have access to (and hardly)— they do not know the severity of what their bodies will go through. In the first place, sex education is still frowned upon in the Philippines. God, I really hate, HATE how religion proves time and time again that they are the main reason why we cannot progress as a society. This film is beautifully filmed, I loved every bit of it.

Gets na gets ko—and I hope many more people will get it, too. This film struck a deep chord with me. Nearly every scene felt like it could happen in real life—and in many cases, it truly does.Abortion is treated like a sin in this godforsaken conservative and dominantly Catholic country. Many people disagree, but it really doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. In the end, the decision should be up to the woman who’s pregnant. We shouldn’t have an opinion—just understanding is enough. After all, it's her body, her life, her future, her choice. That's why I'll always firmly believe that abortion should be legal and safe. There are women—and even girls—who are far too young, forced into pregnancy, still unstable, still trying to build their own lives, and completely unprepared to raise a child while chasing their dreams. Abortion is healthcare, and access to it is a basic reproductive right.This film captures that reality so loudly. It’s loud with the streets of Manila, with people’s judgment, with hypocrisy. You can hear it all so clearly—the way society pushes women toward unreliable and dangerous methods like pamparegla in Quiapo or hilot, simply because abortion is condemned and proper reproductive healthcare is lacking. It’s so fucked up and heartbreaking. Tangina, ang hirap-hirap maging babae sa bansang ’to—sa mundong ’to.'Yung scene na walang filter na ipinakita ang estado ng public hospitals—mga serbisyong galing sa buwis ng tao pero hindi nila kayang ayusin—sobrang sakit panoorin. Sobrang bulok ng sistema natin. And there’s probably something even worse behind it—we are so fucked.So when Sunshine finally went through with the abortion, I felt relieved. For a moment, I was scared she might keep the baby. Bringing a child into the world when you’re not ready—and being forced to give up your own dreams because of it—is one of the most cruel things you can do to yourself and to that child.

Through Sunshine’s story, the film becomes a quiet yet devastating reflection of how our society—and deeply, its systems—continue to fail women. One of the film’s most harrowing moments is the scene where Sunshine rescues Mary Grace after she nearly dies from a self-induced abortion. It is not just a moment of personal crisis; it is a painful exposure of how inaccessible, judgmental, and unsafe our healthcare system remains for women…",2025-11-28,1,0,watch,True

lowbitrae,10,"Gets.I was gonna leave it there but I have thoughts so full steam ahead—Manila is a staple in almost every Filipino film, being the capital and all, but rather than the large city itself— Sunshine specifically captures the essence of Quiapo so well. The bustling markets, the overcrowd and kids begging for alms, and religion is embedded everywhere— whether it be its churches, the posters within the buildings, street stalls selling rebultos and rosaries, or the people themselves. I don't usually care for the setting of the story but I always think it's smart when it actually helps drive the narrative forward, so I find this neat little aspect of the film amusing (also, while we're at it, props to whoever the prod designer is wow). I watched this at 3AM during a vigil so I had all the time to read other reviews and can I just say, while I understand how it could be viewed as such— I don't think this film was didactic or propaganda. I love films that open conversations and Sunshine opened a lot, but more than the conversations it opened, I love how the center of it has always been women. The heart of Sunshine is Sunshine herself, and Maris Racal definitely gave the performance of a lifetime in this one. The fact that she filmed this the same time as Can't Buy Me Love is insane, talk about range.Also, props to Direk Tonet 'cause I have only watched this film a day before, but it is so dear to my heart.

FUCK YOU BOBOT!! now lets talk about the people who supported sunshine along the way, starting with her sister. Honestly, with how close they were i was really surprised that sunshine never told her. all of their scenes were just so heart warming and it really just felt so comforting. i feel like she was someone that sunshine really needed at the time and yknow those words probably meant so much to sunshine. i got a little teary eyed during that scene cuz it was just so 🥹next, the doctora. notice how it was a woman who risked her lisence and did everything to save the pregnant girl? yeah, thats what i call girlhood 😎 but yeah, i was just so happy that someone, an actual stranger, reached out a helping hand. even though she had very little screentime, i really enjoyed her character and it really just showed that there are still some good people out there.moving on, we have the pregnant girl. her hug with sunshine absolutely made me cry. idk, maybe seeing someone going through the same things as her just brought some comfort like atleast theyre both in this together. her almost dying made me feel something, it was either goosebumps or just deadass misery.. i guess a HM would be the coach. (no i am not mentioning the kid cry about it 😒)overall, this was such a beautiful movie. i felt everything and it just captured the life of a filipina so well. just shows how much one person could be going through and how much a woman has to do to simply get rid of her baby. def watch this if you have time!!",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,True

deedeedot,10,"If your moral values believe that no child should be aborted, sana kasama rin sa values nyo na walang babaeng deserved na mahirapan dahil sa unwanted pregnancy. Women needs to have choice, if we always shame women na nabuntis, bakit hindi natin ibaling sa mga nakabuntis ang sisi? Sa buong panonood ko, nainis ako kay Elijah Canlas, sa nanay ni xyril, kay Piolo Pascual, dun sa nagtitinda ng pampalaglag, dun sa doctor na ayaw mag-admit ng batang naghihingalo dahil gumawa daw ng ilegal (mind you, narape yan kaya sya buntis), at sa ospital na hindi kayang i-cater ang pangangalaga sa mga kababaihan. Sana imbes na ijudge si sunshine sa choices nya, sana namulat tayong lahat na we should be free of our choices. Na hindi tayo selfish dahil lang ayaw natin ng anak. And that we are entitled to be taken care of kahit ano pang desisyon natin when it comes to our pregnancy. Sobrang lupit ng mundo natin, na patuloy na nagtataas ng kilay kapag tungkol sa SOGIE pero wala ring ginagawang hakbang kapag nagkakaroon ng unwanted pregnancy ang mga kababaihan.

You can give everything, train like crazy, be so talented, pero minsan hirap ka pa rin mabuhay. Ang bigat pero ang totoo.Sunshine’s character feels real and strong.
