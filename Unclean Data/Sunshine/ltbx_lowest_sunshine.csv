hotgotto,1,"jadaone never fails to deliver a movie that starts strong but falls flat and chokes on the message it’s attempting to tell, whatever that may be. every story she writes is abysmal and surface level and almost always advocates for shallow feminism, hanggang doon nalang ba tayo? spouting for women’s rights without actually understanding the nuance of what you’re actually advocating for?maliban sa poverty porn na kinatutuwaan ipakita palagi ni jadaone, from fan girl to sunshine, she also likes showcasing sexual assault as a plot device, only this time it wasn’t shown to us explicitly—wow, how she’s advanced in her writing noh? (sarcasm meant)while i appreciate the gritty and emotional moments of the film especially when the focus is entirely on the movie’s protagonist who it’s named after (maris carried this entire film along with the supporting cast’s acting) it’s overshadowed by it’s dogshit abysmal surface level performative writing, its inclusion of imaginary children that is either a representation of the characters and their inner child or their unborn children which confuses and irritates me as they’re shown way too much, the on the nose messaging of conservatism in the philippines, the lack of detail on how important sunshine’s dream actually is because it focuses on another separate character that rids sunshine a chunk of her story and conflict, and the abstract, hollow message they’re trying to advocate for.genuinely, can we take the pen away from this grown ass woman? not only does she exploit the masa to serve her story but women as well, nakakabastos sa totoo lang, not very feminist and not very for the masa also—add to the fact that jadaone probably thinks that her audience is stupid and can’t read in between the lines for how she chooses to write the story. more actions, less words sana, more time spent in the writer’s room, less color-grading and filming quiapo’s slums for your poverty porn sana.i could say more but i’d have to give half a star at least for the cast’s amazing performances, they carried this film, and they deserve the recognition especially maris racal. also nagulat ako andito pala si piolo pascual haha.",2025-11-29,5,0,watch,False

rell_,3,"Maraming binukas to na diskurso, pero walang sinara. Ang pinaka-statement ng pelikula patungkol sa teenage/unwanted pregnancy ay: my body, my rules. Na sa kabilang banda ay tama naman, na sa kabilang banda ay hungkag na konseptong liberal. Nakita ng bida ang iba't ibang side ng unwanted pregnancy sa bansa, tulad nung nangyari sa 13 yrs old na side character na lumpen na ginagahasa ng kanyang tito sa tulong ng kanyang mama. Hindi yon unwanted pregnancy dulot ng sarili niyang kapasyahan na makipagtalik ng walang proteksyon. Bunga ito ng sistematikong exploitasyon ng kabataang kababaihan bilang pambayad utang ng kanilang mga magulang. Isa sa mga sanga ng patriyarkal na pananamantala sa sistemang kapital. Ang tanong ngayon ay anong epekto nito sa bida. Ang sagot ay wala. Chase your dreams, choose yourself, my body, my rules.Kahit sa background, walang hudyat ng pagtutol. Ng paglaban para sa abortion. Ng panawagan para sa kapakanan ng mga kabataan at kababaihan. Ng pagtuligsa sa sistemang lumilikha ng uring lumpen. Kaya as much as social commentary ito ng sitwasyon ng kababaihan sa bansa, hungkag at supot ito dahil hindi ito makalahatang panig. Ikumpara halimbawa sa Maynila ni Lino Brocka, kung saan sa kabila ng hindi pagsali ni Julio sa mga protesta, ay nandoon palagi ang mga aktibista, sa likod ng bida, sumisiksik bilang background noise sa panahon ng kanyang mga paglilimi. Ang pakikibaka ay nariyan, ang pelikula ay isang behikulo ng social commentary para ipakita ang lahat ng nariyan.Sa kabila ng husay ng pelikula na buksan ang usapin patungkol sa abortion, kulang na kulang ito sa pagtulak ng kampanya. Pulitikal ang sinusubukan pasukin ng pelikula, pero takot itong pumanig at pinipilit pumagitna. Sumatotal, ang liberalistang posisyon sa abortion e humahantong sa charity para sa mga nasa laylayan na hindi nakakatamasa ng 'my body, my rules' dahil wala sila sa pusisyon para talaga mamili. Nakakaiyak, oo, nakakabagabag damdamin. Nakakagalit, oo, pero ano ngayon? Ang husay ng mga mamemelikula ay bigyan direksyon ang audience sa kung anong dapat gawin pagkatapos -- lalo na social commentary. Ano ang landas palabas ng reyalidad na inilalahad ng kwento? Pano tayo aalpas sa patriyarkal-kapitalistang kuntsabahan na nananamantala sa ating mga kababaihan? Ano ang landas palabas ng pelikula? Dapat marunong mag-imagine ang socially-aware na mamemelikula kung paano babaguhin ang reyalidad na sinasalamin niya sa kanyang pelikula.

robbgc,3,"SUNSHINE advances itself as a film about bodily autonomy in a nation that denies its very terminology, yet it does so through the insulated idiom of psychological realism rather than the concretised mapping of the material conditions that make autonomy, abortion, and girlhood existentially precarious. We are immersed in affect, but the structure underpinning these sensations is left either ambient or altogether unrendered. Yes, the pharmacy exists as a moral space and the hospital as carceral, but where is the livelihood? Who funds the training? What does it mean, materially, to be a 19-year-old athlete—and an international one, at that—with no visible labouring parent and no bread line to back it up?Abortion is outlawed in the Philippines because it preserves state-church power and results in the reproductive labour of the poor as exploitable and their agency criminal, but to bracket class from the narrative—in a context where economic vulnerability is the foremost determinant of reproductive injustice—is consequential. Instead, the endless deferral into mood, while expressive, is in itself a seductive alibi for political disengagement. I understand that this is a film of interiority—that the point is to reflect Sunshine’s constrained perceptual field—but her interiority is a response to economic realities that the film chooses to elude, and when the audience is asked to interpolate systemic weight from ambience without any clear depiction of how deprivation functions, what we get is an abstraction that parades as empathy, and from that abstraction, other evasions proliferate: the neoliberal myth of the meritocratic athlete, whose suffering must be understood as psychological strain rather than as infrastructural abandonment; the convenient fiction that ambition alone propels a body through state-sponsored regimes without subsidy or the material realities the film forgoes. To abstract oppression into psychic distress then, while refusing its logistical origins, is to risk reproducing the same symbolic economy the Church relies upon: one in which the body is meaningful only as a metaphor and a vessel onto which morality is projected.This aesthetic disposition of interiority is of course obviously a structure inherited from the exportable idiom of European festival realism where the trauma of the Filipina is depicted legibly for the global North. From this perspective, it would make sense that the institutions that manufacture her precarity are rendered as emotional rather than historical, inviting the audience to feel with her but never to account—but by doing so, what emerges is not so much a Filipino film but a Filipino offering: an artefact of pain rendered in tones familiar to jurors abroad, a choice that aligns seamlessly with both (1) Jadaone’s career pivot into the international circuit, having premiered the film at Berlinale and TIFF, and (2) the film’s own final sequence: Sunshine performing her routine at the SEA games before a panel of foreign adjudicators, body taut and calibrated for approval by those who will never understand the weight of what she forfeited to arrive there. By naming these two parallels do we metabolise the rage of a system into something palatable and interpretable, and since both Jadaone and Sunshine must contort to be seen, in being seen, they are asked to become less what they mean. Perhaps the question is not whether SUNSHINE fails as a film or recedes as an offering, but whether it was ever permitted the autonomy to be anything else—whether within the landscape of Philippine cinema, where funding is precarious, distribution systems anaemic, and state culture support present only for the films that do not threaten it, a film like SUNSHINE must already enter the frame pre-legibilised and pre-digested, its rage ironed out for export. This is, after all, by the admission of its own producer Bianca Balbuena, a film that delayed its domestic release in order ‘to premiere in top festivals [around] the world to create noise and curiosity’, with the implication that only through international approval could the film attain enough value to justify its own existence at home. Thus, to resist the very circuit that enables its existence is impossible, but recognising this sharpens our understanding of the conditions under which those evasions occur. What we must ask, then, is what kind of complicity we are willing to forgive in a nation that punishes truth so severely that even its cinema must contort just to be heard.",2025-07-28,48,1,watch,False

n1ghtcrawler,4,"I had been waiting a long time to watch Sunshine, especially since I never got the chance to see it on the big screen. So, when it finally arrived on Netflix, I was so excited, only for that excitement to fade the longer I watched.The premise is undeniably compelling: a young gymnast discovers she’s pregnant just as her lifelong dream of reaching the Olympics is within reach. It’s a setup filled with emotional stakes and potential for a powerful, character-driven story.But instead of exploring her dedication to the sport, the film shifts almost entirely to her pregnancy and her attempts to deal with it. I kept waiting for scenes that would show her fighting for her dream, intense training, the pressure of competition, the physical and emotional toll of gymnastics, but those moments never really come. The narrative focuses more on side characters and subplots that feel unnecessary and, frankly, uninteresting.I couldn’t help comparing this film to other international athlete biopics that portray the grit, passion, and relentless work behind the journey. Sunshine had all the ingredients to deliver that kind of inspiring story, but it simply doesn’t stick the landing.Overall, I’m disappointed.

tepmayo,4,"Sunshine (Maris Racal) is a record-breaking national athlete, but the film fails to show the weight of that achievement.She wears a tank top marked “Asian Games 2018,” and her coach (Meryll Soriano) warns her against complacency: “Balewala lahat ng gold mo sa Asian Games.”Since the Asian Games are held every four years, and Sunshine is about 19 or 20, this suggests she won multiple golds in 2018 — a rare feat. She would be gymnastics royalty, a media darling, likely the most successful Filipina rhythmic gymnast in history.Yet the film doesn’t show her as a public figure. No news clippings, no media buzz, no crowds—just a few kids asking for a selfie. It also focuses mostly on her ribbon routine, barely showing the hoop, ball, or clubs—all key to establishing her as Olympic-level.Sunshine’s decision to abort is quick, and her fears and ambitions are underexplored. The Olympics, in fact, feel more like her coach’s dream—the film tells us this but doesn’t show it.There’s no pressure from a country rooting for her, nor from sponsors who presumably funded her expensive training (which we’re left to assume, since rhythmic gymnastics is an elite sport). No rival gymnast, no sense of competition, no major stakes, and no real glimpse into the demanding world of elite sport.All this undercuts the tension around her unwanted pregnancy.Jadaone instead spends a chunk of screen time on soapy magical realism. An imaginary, foul-mouthed child follows Sunshine around, mocking her decisions. But instead of adding insight, this character becomes repetitive and irritating.Rhed Bustamante plays another pregnant teen, awkwardly inserted into the plot in an effort to cover too many sides of the abortion debate. But Rhed’s more serious situation makes Sunshine’s dilemma feel shallow—like a story about a girl careless with sex and unwilling to face the consequences.Some visuals in Sunshine hit hard: abortifacients sold beside religious icons outside Quiapo Church—a jab at how the Catholic Church, in practice, is more ritual than moral compass. There’s also a grim motel scene. But these moments can’t save the film.Set in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, where abortion is illegal, Sunshine tries to raise issues around teen pregnancy and reproductive rights, like overcrowded maternity wards. True enough, the Philippines has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, especially among the poor.But if a film brings this up, it must give some context. The Reproductive Health Law, passed only in 2012, was meant to help—but the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) continues to fight tooth and nail against sex education and birth control.The film ignores all this. Instead, it gives us a cartoonish, Bible-thumping doctor and a patriarchal pastor—villains standing in for real problems. We don’t expect to be spoon-fed, but when a film enters controversial ground and hints at bigger issues, it has a duty to avoid shallow symbols.In the end, Sunshine parrots Western slogans like “My body, my choice” without anchoring its stance in the Philippine context. The message feels imported and emotionally flat.🔴READ FULL REVIEW (DAILY TRIBUNE): https://tribune.net.ph/2025/07/26/sunshine-review-abortion-tale-misses-the-mark",2025-07-27,148,2,rewatch,False

redbacon,4,"Switching between goofy magic realism, teenage coming-of-age clichés and a gritty look at the reality of trying to get an abortion in the Philippines — which is prohibited in the constitution itself — Sunshine is a heartfelt story with an angry edge. Maris Racal stars as the wonderfully-named Sunshine Francisco, an aspiring gymnast whose potential tryouts at the Olympics are derailed by an unexpected pregnancy. With no officials to turn to, she is forced to search the black market, where she is followed by a strange young girl (Annika Co) who appears to be a figment of her imagination (it’s obvious when no one else interacts!). While the film certainly draws awareness to this issue of women’s rights in the Philippines, Jadaone’s cornier tendencies overwhelm the message.Part of our Berlinale Generation coverage",2025-02-18,27,1,watch,False

Indirectly, the filmmaker supports having an abortion for the sake of her dreams and future life.Imagine what if mom chooses not to give birth to me in order to achieve her dreams of her youth. of course I won't mind, I will gladly support mom to get the life she longs for🙌🏻Remembered the conversation that night, about mom's childhood dreams. we all felt guilty hearing her dreams, but mom didn't blame it, she was ready to be a mother, she said her future was her child.

sunjazzfilms,5,"I’ll be honest, underwhelming siya for me. Siguro tumaas lang expectations ko dahil sa dami ng reviews na nakita ko sa social media (na hindi ko binasa para iwas spoiler) at syempre dahil sa haba ng theatrical run niya. What I genuinely liked were the performances. They hired competent actors, and it shows. And since marami na rin akong napanood na Jadaone films, andun pa rin ’yun trademark angst niya—and I love that for her.Ang hindi ko kinaya ay ’yun imaginary children. Siguro kasi sobrang dami ko nang nakitang ganitong atake sa short films at full-length lalo na kapag tungkol sa abortion kaya hindi na bago sa paningin ko. I get kung bakit siya ginamit as a plot device to feel “innovative,” especially with a message that wants to tell the masses na okay lang piliin ang sarili at magpa-abort. Importanteng mensahe ’yun.Kaso… hindi ako nadala emotionally. May mga babae akong kakilala na nagpa-abort at grabe ’yun pinagdaanan nila. Compared sa mga kwentong narinig ko, ang nipis lang ng emotional experience ni Sunshine sa film. Kaya siguro nainis ako sa imaginary children na atake. The feeling itself of learning you're pregnant tapos mag-decide to get an abortion already carries so many complex emotions. Hindi mo na kailangan idikit pa ’yun mga bata to prove a point.Hindi ko rin nagustuhan na parang ang babaw ng pagkakahandle sa kwento nung batang na-rape ng tito niya. Pakiramdam ko ibang pelikula dapat ’yun—isang pelikula na mas malalim at mas handang i-tackle ’yun bigat ng topic.Feeling ko kung lalaki ka, baka mas ""oks"" itong film para sayo.

I don't understand why they would choose such a topic and not really have a stance on it. Maybe the creators themselves are also confused as to being pro-choice or pro-life, as are most Filipinos due to their religious beliefs (I'm assuming). I'm just saying, if you didn't want to get ""too"" political by having a clearer opinion in the film, then it's probably best to take more time and do more research about the topic, or just make another kind of movie.",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,False

It even brings up the age old question of “If you’re against abortion what about a child that is a victim of rape?” through that one character.

I wanted the film to really expound on her emotions, not just kids being a figment of her imagination being used as a way to talk about her feelings without showing it.

However, depicting Sunshine’s unborn child as the opposite of that—a fully grown child that is even capable of swearing and questioning her mother’s decisions—defeats the purpose of the film. That way of thinking is exactly why we are not making any progress in legalizing abortion. In a truly pro-choice film, the story would only be about how Sunshine deserves to be safe and supported as she pursues her athletic ambitions. For a film that boldly criticizes closed-minded Christians, I found it confusing why it was simultaneously trying to seem neutral by giving the pro-life argument some representation. I thought it was going to be braver than that. On top of the ambiguity of its politics is the underwhelming presentation of what is at stake for Sunshine. Many scenes still felt a little too shallow, quick, and simple. As if the film is telling me a story I’m supposed to already know. For a supposedly hard-hitting film, not much was framed as a revelation.

But that's the thing, it's myopic that it themes and logic of the narrative presented is as only limited as the filmmaker's worldview to say the least, or rather it is limited to how Jadaone sees the subject matter in regards to abortion and having an agency which is told in such a simplistic way, lacking that empathy and how objective it is. However, I commend the script to call out against the prejudiced perception but that's how it is, it did not hold accountable to it, and while Sunshine had conviction to make her decision in the end, and matters in her own hands, it didn't feel unearned to be honest. Like who is Sunshine to the audience, as a main character? Why do the audience should root for her, I think the screenplay failed to make its audience care and thank god Maris Racal made it somehow work because she did put effort to act in those dramatic scenes and it shows she's into that role, kudos for putting an extra work on gymnastic scenes.But in some light hearted scenes, it felt like she didn't convey those emotions that at times it felt monotone. She could've shown a more human and relatable side of Sunshine.It didn't helped that the runtime could've expanded or improve some things that were lacking, but overall the film did ok. Lastly, I have a message to those who are invoking Brocka's name or likening it to the film or the filmmaker: ""keep his name out of your mouth.""",2025-07-29,2,0,watch,False

domfr_nc,5,"This film is, at its core, a well-intentioned and emotionally resonant film. It tackles difficult subject matter with sincerity, and for the most part, it does so with grace. However, I found that the inclusion of fantastical or imaginary elements occasionally detracted from the weight of its core issues. While I understand the metaphorical ambition behind these stylistic choices as well as their function in softening the emotional blows with humor or levity, I believe the film is at its most powerful when it forgoes embellishment and leans fully into the raw intensity of its subject matter. In those moments, when it embraces the chaos, the pain, and the emotional urgency it really becomes something far more affecting and memorable, allowing the simplicity it strives for to emerge, though it’s often overshadowed. At times, the dialogue veers into overtly inspirational or didactic terrain, feeling more like affirmations meant to uplift than naturalistic exchanges between characters. It’s clear that the film doesn’t only aim to tell a story, it wants to educate, to empower, to stir social consciousness. Yet in doing so, it sometimes edges closer to the tone of an educational TV movie than a fully realized work of cinema. That’s not a critique of its moral imperative, it’s a film that should be shown in schools but rather an observation about its limitations as a piece of narrative storytelling. The emotional and ideological weight it seeks to carry isn’t always supported by the nuance or complexity that cinematic storytelling demands.What grounds the film and gives it its most enduring power is its emotional core. Maris Racal delivers a performance of quiet strength and vulnerability, anchoring the film with remarkable consistency. Especially compelling is the subplot involving Rhed Bustamante’s character. Without revealing too much, her arc resonated with me more deeply than the central storyline. It was heartbreakingly authentic, subtle, restrained, and profoundly human. In that thread, the film touches something honest and unflinching.I also admired Antoinette Jadaone’s formal restraint in certain key scenes, particularly her choice to mute the sound. In a film so concerned with voice and expression, those pockets of silence carried tremendous weight. They allowed the viewer a moment of stillness, a space for reflection and imbued the film with a haunting quietude that deepened the emotional stakes.That said, the film’s message doesn’t always land with clarity. After a pivotal hospital scene, I overheard two audience members blame the protagonist for her choices, siding with the doctor who confronts her. That reaction, while anecdotal, reveals a significant shortcoming: the narrative may not have sufficiently challenged ingrained prejudices or prompted the kind of empathy it aspired to cultivate. It bravely addresses urgent topics- reproductive rights, bodily autonomy, the realities of being a young woman navigating unjust systems but the film doesn’t always sharpen these into a coherent or persuasive argument. In trying to reach everyone, it occasionally loses the sharpness needed to truly confront.Still, “Sunshine” is a valuable film, one with earnestness, compassion, and purpose. Its flaws are born of ambition: the desire to inspire, to uplift, and to inform all at once. But perhaps empowerment doesn’t always need to be accompanied by joy. Sometimes, it is in the unvarnished confrontation of pain without fantasy, without consolation that we discover our deepest strength. I don’t mean to suggest the film ought to have ended in despair, but rather that its final act, which shifts into metaphor and closes with a success story, might have benefitted from something more grounded, more unresolved or ambiguous . Real life rarely provides a clean arc, and in a film so rooted in truth, the ending felt almost too easy, too neat.",2025-07-26,11,1,watch,False

macjohnearl,5,"We are in a limbo. So much of Philippine cinema, especially that which makes the rounds in local and international film festivals, is stuck churning out “groundbreaking” firsts. Because our cultural discourse is so behind, our filmmakers are tasked not only with telling stories, but also with inventing the stories to be told. They’re required to stake out new thematic ground, not in service of aesthetic evolution, but simply to keep up with the global conversation. The cost of this is a cinema that often feels overburdened with didactic intent and undernourished in emotional and formal rigor.In a particularly polarizing gesture, Jadaone introduces a hallucinated child character, a device that indirectly echoes Jojo Rabbit (2019). But this choice results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as farce to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, literalizes it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. What’s more revealing than the film itself is the discourse surrounding it: a ubiquity of gender-essentialist and bioessentialist defenses, as if any critique of any form is automatically a threat to representation. That instinct: to guard a film’s cause rather than evaluate its craft just proves how far behind we are as a nation in talking about gender politics in filmmaking. The refusal to embrace genuinely revolutionary tactics, whether in politics or art, has kept us coasting on the optics of progress ever since.Full review for the Kinoise Substack published here",2025-07-24,61,2,watch,False

ceptune,5,"Very backlogged review but hey, to have a star such as Maris (who is great in this film) lead in a controversial topic in this day and age is a breath of fresh air. Antoinette Jadaone steps out of her comfort zone yet again to bring out one of her bolder works. I am happy that something like this is out there, don't get me wrong, but there is something so off and odd about representing their struggles with hallucinatory unborn children. Feels almost counterproductive. In the talkback, direk says that she was inspired by Jojo Rabbit with this style of narrative and I wish she went deeper in explaining her reasoning.

thanksamovie,6,"THE FILM SUNSHINE (2024), IS REALLY A SUNSHINE? 1000%! YES IT IS!What’s more amazingly beautiful about the screenplay & direction is how the film starts and how it ends. Interestingly, there are moments where she silences the noise and does what she feels and loves. It also acts as a symbolic gesture of how she manages to pull herself out of an unwanted situation: the way she shuts down all the chaos and harsh experiences.The film is a social critique of how, for more than a century, certain laws have undermined reproductive rights, and how 1000s of Filipino women die each year from complications. Although the film is native to the Philippines, its commentary reflects many countries where abortion rights are still completely prohibited.It is not merely directed toward capturing Sunshine's journey (played by Maris Racal) facing psychological and emotional conflict within society; it also explores the dynamics of the families involved, especially her elder sister with a months-old baby, crafted in a way that reflects Sunshine's future & the collapse of her dreams.What I loved most is how director Antoinette creatively puts Sunshine’s moral consciousness as a physical character, played by Annika Co, showing how it never really leaves her. Their conversations are intricately written, sometimes her conscience is angry and argumentative, and sometimes it simply smiles back at her.All in all, it is film that softens & sharpens at the same time. It gives voice to the women who are rarely heard & reveals the emotional truth behind difficult choices. Above all, it reminds us that agency is power, and that every woman deserves the right to define her own future.",2025-12-06,0,0,watch,False

pockypiko,6,"DROWN OUT THE NOISE.Sunshine (2024), directed by Antoinette Jadaone, follows Sunshine (Maris Racal), a young rhythmic gymnast who dreams of making the national team and competing in the Olympics. Her life takes a sudden turn when she discovers she is pregnant right before the final selection. Refusing to give up on her dream or her life, she desperately searches for an illegal way to terminate the pregnancy in a society where abortion is strictly prohibited.Fyi, this is the first Filipino film I’ve ever watched, and surprisingly it’s pretty ok. It feels like a fusion of Posesif (2017) and Dua Garis Biru (2019) combine those two and you basically get Sunshine. Overall I still enjoyed it, but I think the chasing the dream aspect, which should’ve been the core of the film, felt meh. There weren’t really any moments that pushed the conflict harder. For example, revealing Sunshine’s pregnancy during her rhythmic gymnastics training, or showing how exhausting her training was to the point she almost gave up. Little things like that could’ve made the struggle hit much deeper. That’s just my random thought, but I do feel those moments would’ve strengthened the heart of the story, since Sunshine’s core conflict truly lies in chasing her dream as an athlete and the harsh reality she’s forced to face.",2025-12-05,10,0,watch,False

iceddunkin,6,"First Letterboxd essay — I had an itch to scratch so bad with this one. Also medyo late, crammer kasi year-end na :) Right off the bat, I knew how reviews of this film would look like. At hindi naman nagkamali. This film is highly praised, receiving remarks such as masterpiece, brave, and a stepping stone.Yet to my surprise, a few share the same sentiments I had, thoughts that were brewing in me while watching Sunshine. Kaya rin ang hirap buuin ng review na ito (bukod sa hindi naman talaga ako nag-eessay sa plataporma na ito), kasi ayoko maging echo lamang.Anyways, just for the sake of sharing kahit onti:(1) I agree that the supposed personified child is, safe to say, contradictory. Kahit may explanation si Direk Jadaone, it still felt conflicting and made the film unsure of itself.(2) The introduction of some characters felt out of place. In some aspect parang chess yan, character placement and arcs matter, so the player must be aware of their moves.(3) The slap in the face commentary on religion felt overdone. Sayang ang parts and points na pwede pang mahimay.Oh diba, dami niyang sinasabi. But in all honesty, I really felt the need to essay the hell out of this review. Mahalaga sa akin ang usapang SRH at syempre mahalaga rin sa akin na maging diskurso ito.And dahil diyan, here’s a point I feel no one else has raised. Personally, it felt like under-researched ang pelikula. Bakit? Mababaw pa ang na-capture nitong realidad ng abortion at ang hirap na nadadanas ng kababaihan sa kalusugan. These are things you would know agad with one simple search on Reddit. Gets ba? (Lol) And to think na mas layered and complex pa dapat ito sa sitwasyon ni Sunshine, as a student-athlete with financial instability. Sayang lang, ano? Syempre may good points din ang Sunshine sa pananaw ko. Visually, it did its thing. Acting, no doubt, great talents, especially Maris and Jennica. The fact that I watched this with my parents and that they were genuinely interested and concerned about the film is a good point.Sa dulo naman, baka expectations ko rin ang rason kaya ko ito naisip.

bizkunm,6,"""gets ko na""that line literally sent me into the abyss. going into the film, i was so confused about the little girl following sunshine. i thought she was sunshine’s inner child, like a guide through the mess, reminding her who she was and what she actually wanted. but when they introduced ariana, the kid that “bata” playmate during that night, everything started clicking.then the incident happened. mary grace (rhed bustamante) tried to get an abortion, and her baby died. when we saw ariana recognize mary grace, and then later, at the hospital, the nurse announced the baby didn’t make it… ariana just disappeared. that’s when it hit me: ariana and bata was supposed to represent the baby, their baby. it felt ironic at first because you’re torn between “should i feel bad?” and “should i feel sad about the literal premise of the film?” but then bata said to sunshine, “gets ko na,” and the whole film just punched my soul.maris racal is easily one of the best actresses of this generation, and sunshine proves that. the film is raw, very indie pinoy cinema vibes, and it works. it also doesn’t shy away from the heavy stuff, like how brutal the philippines can be when judging teenage pregnancy and abortion. the shame, the gossip, the pressure to “keep it,” the lack of safe spaces… the film shows how hard it is for girls to make choices about their own bodies when everyone feels entitled to comment.i just kinda wish they explored sunshine being a public athlete more, like the public eye, the rumors, the judgment she’d face online and her community as the time goes by. the ending showing her making it to the sea games was nice, but i feel like addressing the backlash and the pressure could’ve made the story even stronger.overall: great film. beautiful, painful, and honest. i love you, sunshine.",2025-11-27,0,0,watch,True

tenderpretender,6,"Abortion is such a complicated moral dilemma, and I personally lean toward not agreeing with it, so it was hard for me to empathize with the protagonist. A lot of her suffering felt like the result of her own choices, and the film’s attempt to make me feel sorry for her by surrounding her with awful people sometimes felt manipulative.The imaginary child concept also didn’t always work for me. She’s clearly meant to be a moral compass or a symbol of societal pressure, but without her, the film already shows how judgmental and unforgiving the world around her is. It made her presence feel more forced than meaningful. Sometimes I see her just to connect story and keep the plot moving or a way to feel sorry for her more.However, I connected more with the side character’s story. I can understand why abortion is legal if thats the case. Her pain and the horror that she went through and also affecting how I see Sunshine. nevertheless, I still think it’s worth watching.

gabmorato,6,"Sunshine is undeniably a political film—one that challenges the norms and cultural assumptions of the Filipino psyche. It is the kind of film that is marketed in such a way like an indie local blockbuster. Yung tipong kakagatin ng professors back in senior high or college and ipapa-assignment, and there is no doubt why many would watch it with unquestioning interest.Maris Racal delivers a committed performance, fully inhabiting a character who makes questionable and sometimes erratic choices. Her portrayal is compelling, yet it’s hampered by a script that lacks the gravitas her story deserves. While the film touches on important issues, it never fully dives deep, ultimately limiting the emotional impact.Antoinette Jadaone’s direction, though ambitious, is occasionally overshadowed by comedic moments that dilute the film’s central message about women’s rights. I found myself thinking, “Seryoso ka ba, Direk?”—because the challenges had already been clearly established. As someone who strongly believes in a woman’s autonomy over her body, I appreciate the film’s intentions, but the execution leaves the core message feeling imposed and emotionally flat by the end. Honestly, the audience I was with, mostly magbabarkada—kept asking, “Pinalaglag niya ba? o hindi?” “Open ended nanaman lagi yang director na yan” and it frustrated me, because even if everything was already implied, it signaled that there’s a group of audience that failed to get the message. Which then leads me to the point that the weight of personal choice—the triumph and struggle inherent in it—is never fully realized, which keeps the story from resonating as deeply as it could. Gets ko na, pero sana gets niyo rin.Sunshine is a film with admirable intentions and flashes of brilliance, yet it struggles to fully harness its potential. Actually, it’s a palatable film about that struggle. To say na ang tapang ng pelikula na ‘to is a feat that I don’t think it deserves fully. It is a conversation starter, but one that often feels louder than it is profound, gaya nga ng sabi ni Sunshine sa pagpalit niya ng kanta sa set niya — parang kulang sa heart.",2025-08-06,2,0,watch,False

It’s a conversation starter, but its certainly does not explore much of the topic that its centered on. So much so that the film doesn’t really let you grow to care about the Protagonist’s support system, thus their presence, their wisdom and their comfort, falls flat in terms of having and relevance to you. There are moments wherein I enjoyed the humor, but you can only do so much with curse words in dialogues that it starts to sound like Daryl Yap’s films, the only difference here is that it handled a topic that’s taboo and has managed to deliver its point across, however at the expense of being safe enough to be told, but less poignant and thought provoking to be considered as something to be discussed in depth.

gmcajayon,6,"Yesterday, I stumbled upon a Twitter post pointing out parallelisms between Jadaone's Sunshine and Brocka's Insiang with how both films' main characters, in at least one scene, were framed behind bars, mirroring their metaphorical imprisonment within gendered norms of their respective social milieus. Indeed, although almost 50 years have passed between the two films, it's an unfortunate reality that women's rights in the Philippines still have a long way to go, with conservative Catholic values hindering its advancement. Both Jadaone and Brocka present us with their titular characters' fractured psyches, trying everything within their limited power to achieve some kind of self-emancipation. Another Twitter post, however, posits that while Jadaone echoes Brocka in some ways, she ultimately diverges from him by virtue of her ""woman's instinct"" that also augments her narratives with an ""added layer."" Obvious gender essentialism and identity politics aside, this is a sentiment that I'm keen on interrogating: what does it actually mean to have a female directorial sensibility, particularly in the vein of Antoinette Jadaone?An easy answer would be to look at the central conflict of Sunshine, that is, unwanted pregnancy, and that Jadaone opts for a female teenager as its main focalizer. I'm pointing this out because trans men and intersex people can also get pregnant hence a pregnancy plot point would not inherently be women-specific (although there would surely be many overlaps), so it's Jadaone's directorial decision to create a female protagonist that imbues the film with intricacies of the female experience---how proceeding with motherhood would be career suicide for an athlete aiming for the Olympics, how Sunshine is constantly berated by self-righteous people she encounters, how society itself was built against female self-determination, and despite all these, how Sunshine finds small pockets of refuge in other women---a friend, a mentor, an inn receptionist, a doctor, an abused prepubescent, a sister---who are empathetic enough to understand her pain and conviction, and to whom she's equally compelled to reciprocate kindness whenever the situation permits.Further, Jadaone digs deeper and finds the Catholic religious institution, itself a remnant of feudalism, as an underlying hegemonic force against women empowerment, so culturally embedded in Philippine society that Sunshine finds it wherever she goes, be it in the drugstore, in the hospital, in the university, in the sport that she loves, even in the man who got her pregnant. Unfortunately, here is also where Jadaone's supposed female sensibility loses steam: religious guilt is so ubiquitous that even she is not aware that it limits her perspective, that instead of finding multiple angles of inquiry she instead chooses to hammer in the same anti-religious (therefore anti-patriarchal) talking point over and over and over again, even to the point of physicalizing the unborn children, a weirdly pro-life creative decision in a film that self-categorizes as pro-choice. Heck, the film just assumes that the audience already knows about the economic facets of being a Filipino athlete so it makes no effort in examining it, nor is it concerned with how Sunshine and her family earn their money (nobody seems to be working!). No, those aren't important; just focus on the fact that Sunshine is a woman and that she's oppressed because of it. ""Drown out the noise,"" her coach tells her, but is it really necessary to drown it out if the noise is as repetitively monotonous (albeit still imminently threatening) as Jadaone presented it?My argument is that uncritical admiration for ""female sensibility"" is as dangerous as the patriarchy it contends with, and that it's the same liberal narrow-sightedness that applauds Jadaone's bravery for tackling taboo gender topics and turns a blind eye to her cowardice in heeding the pro-Palestine boycott of the Berlinale film festival in the same breath; what's the point of female sensibility if it is devoid of anti-fascist solidarity? Perhaps Sunshine is actually a self-surrogate for the lengths Jadaone is willing to go through in pursuit of her career, and we're all just supposed to root for her because it's great that Philippine cinema is acknowledged and praised internationally, everything else be damned.And maybe I'm expecting too much from Jadaone, that I should just accept that her films are self-contained texts that will never reach the same kind of radicalism and depth as Brocka's (which is admittedly a high standard to reach), but deep inside I want to believe that she's capable of bolder, stronger filmic statements.",2025-07-26,96,6,watch,False

iamdamnation,6,"There’s no denying Sunshine matters - it speaks to harsh truths and tackles its themes with care and emotional honesty. The film had a timely subject, sincere writing, and phenomenal acting - Maris Racal was stellar, while Jennica Garcia delivered with quiet power. But I struggled with certain elements, particularly its attempt at magical realism. The presence of the imaginary child felt clunky, tonally jarring, and out of sync with the otherwise grounded narrative. Frankly, the character felt unnecessary - the film had already evolved past the need for her. The story had power, and I wish it had trusted its own strength without the added flourish. Ultimately, I admired its purpose more than loving its execution.",2025-07-25,8,0,watch,False
zarvindale,6,"This is my first film in FOUR months?! It’s horrible for my cinephile ass out here…This is the Happening of Filipino cinema, except it’s less thrilling and more aligned with the traditional storytelling of Filipino drama.Perhaps my favorite element of this new project from Antoinette Jadaone is the contrast between morality and sin as personified by the hawker who sells abortion pills behind figures of saints beside Quiapo Church, which is arguably the most popular place of veneration among Catholic Filipinos throughout the country.Beyond that, I’m struggling to seek nuance and proper closure. What sets this work, aside from the palpable gentleness toward the female main character, apart from the many stories about abortion out there?It’s worth noting, however, that stories about women are told by women, just like what Jadaone manages to deliver here. I believe (cis) male filmmakers, no matter how genuine their intent is, cannot tell stories about women because women’s danas, the distinct Filipino word for experience, is not men’s danas.[Watched at SM Mall of Asia Cinema 1]",2025-07-24,4,0,watch,False
farscribe,6,"Sunshine (2024) would be a perfect double feature with Eliza Hittman's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) as they both tackle similar topics but with a stark difference in privilege and access.where the latter becomes a story of sisterhood and compassion, as two girls cross state lines to get access to healthcare, Sunshine offers no such respite to our eponymous protagonist.in here, what Sunshine wants is not even a matter of choice, it is something that she is forced to bear. all alone as her confidants succumb to the stigma of her dilemma, Sunshine takes to the streets of Manila in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy.the plot moves along while the audience is served scenes of what i believe to be one of the better cinematic depictions of modern Manila. the first few minutes almost feel like an entirely different film (one i would have particularly liked more) until the plot takes a peculiar detour.in all of its realism and poignancy i found a particular element in its storytelling very out of place and oftentimes distracting. while the ending made me understand why those choices were made i just don't think a semblance of Magical Realism is the perfect vehicle for a message as heavy as this one.while i think the point that: ""an entire generation of Filipino women being forced to reckon with their unborn children as if the choice of abortion is something that has to be explained, and in turn, be understood."" is a step in the right direction for this nation's pro-choice discourse, the delivery just felt like it was bordering into Diary of an Unborn Child territory. with that being said, i still thoroughly enjoyed Sunshine and i would still highly recommend it. despite some of my grievances with the film, the unblemished ray of sunshine known as Maris Racal delivers a stellar performance in the titular role. perhaps even a mariesteller one. *wink* *wink*",2025-07-24,3,0,watch,False

theindiealistic,6,"It’s so odd to see Jadaone out of her box—or perhaps returning to her old form. If Fan Girl leaned into the dark, Sunshine veers into the gritty. The clever use of environment makes Maris Racal’s performance feel grounded and central, without overly commenting on political allegories like in Jadaone’s previous work. Orendain’s shots don’t try to elevate the story—they move hand-in-hand with it, gripping tightly to the isolation of being a young woman in the Philippines.I haven’t seen any Filipino film tackle abortion quite like this. The nuance of setting it in a deeply religious country is compelling. It opens the conversation, but perhaps plays a little too safe—maybe to appeal to a broader audience. I was hoping for a stronger push, but it chooses to be understated: a film beaming with quiet urgency and an accurate reflection of the current climate surrounding women’s reproductive rights.",2025-07-23,4,0,watch,False

This film is part compelling drama, with a strong lead performance from the young actor and a powerful examination of the treatment of women in the Phillipines. This film is also part surrealist, but in a way that I feel undermines the strengths of the film. There is a young girl who appears at various points throughout the film; her identity is left to interpretation. However I feel that this apparition weakens every scene she's in. You'll have this powerful understated drama and then this wise-cracking girl appears to swear at you. It is clear that they couldn't even make her fit throughout the film because she disappears for at least half an hour in the middle. The filmmaker said this was the original core concept of the film and I understand that, but I feel that the film moved beyond the need for this character. I will say that I found the final interaction between the girl and our protagonist quite touching. Maybe if the girl was more understated it could have worked better. I do want to mention that it was really lovely to be in the TIFF audience for this one; the Filipino community was so passionate about this film and it was the longest and most involved Q&A I'd ever seen.

sarikaalam,7,"I’ve been waiting for Sunshine's release ever since its TIFF premiere last September. With limited showings, the wait for a global or streaming release felt even longer. When Netflix announced they had acquired the film, I was excited... only to learn it was geo-blocked to the Philippines. But even with its depressing distribution, I can finally say I’ve watched it!As a woman who cares deeply about reproductive rights, the film’s subject matter resonated with me on a level that’s difficult to articulate. Sunshine arrives in an era where there's endless debate over motherhood, declining birth rates & women’s bodily autonomy at large. We're living in a world where conservative politics are resurging, where five years of Tiktok is undoing decades of feminist work, and where technofascists pour billions in service of a pronatalist agenda. In the midst of all the noise and the pressure placed on women’s bodies, Sunshine truly feels like sunshine. It’s a reminder of the lived reality of pregnancy: the physical toll, the emotional burden, the loss of autonomy, and the ways class determines what choices a woman can or cannot afford.Maris Racal delivers a truly compelling performance – her pain is honest and palpable. I loved the dynamic between Sunshine and Geleen; their relationship grounds the film. The scene where Geleen hugs Sunshine and promises to support her decisions no matter what is one of the movie's most affecting moments – an affirmation of sisterhood untouched by financial instability or the harshness of their circumstances.Could the film have done more? Absolutely. There are ideas that could’ve been explored further but in an era when mainstream studios and streaming services seem determined to churn out utter slop, Sunshine feels like a breath of fresh air. I also learnt the title was changed from Gymnast to Sunshine and I think it was the perfect choice for a movie like this (especially with that ending!).

People have to open their eyes to the reality that our options are very limited, especially living in a third world country with such a corrupt government, and how Sunshine was only a high-school student born in a lower class family with only her ate taking care of her.

At JAFF, the director shared a little about how sexual issues are still considered taboo in the Philippines, and how the film also touches on the topic of abortion.Listening to the director speak at JAFF about the impact of this film, several discussions regarding cases of sexual harassment and violence in the Philippines have begun to open up, even if only slightly. According to him, this film has helped pave the way for filmmakers there to create similar works, which are still relatively rare.",2025-12-06,0,0,watch,False

icawatch,7,"This is a really controversial topic especially in the Philippines where abortion is not accepted both legally and as normal norm. Anyways, the movie did great in relying why sometimes some reasons do weigh more in terms of accepting an unwanted child birth, but well I do not actively support it but I respect it. I am not to judge to what they do, because sometimes when you think about it, like for instance that 13 girl who was raped by her mother's boyfriend(What an absolute ahole btw and also the mother??? which brings me that some women is not fit to be a mother. So if you do not want a child please don't be stupid and use protection like always.) is such a nightmare and to think that girl probably do not fully grasp the whole situation she is in, I understand why she also did what she did. Also to end this, if abortion is not allowed, why is contraceptive allowed? Like isn't like almost the same? You are not giving the reproductive cells do well some reproduction. The only difference is that abortion is the baby is already alive but the reproductive cells is prevented to be much more(a new life).",2025-12-05,0,0,watch,False

jazsisante7,7,"I may be on the unpopular side of this: I want to love this so badly but for some reason, I can't help to mull-on & pinpoint some details lacked for me and thought it needed more revising story-wise. I am not hating on this. In fact, I actually like several parts of the movie. I think it's fair to say (and undeniably so) that this is an important and a refreshing story on what's the take of abortion & body autonomy here in the Philippines and I do appreciate this movie for that. (I added the half star plus because it still is an important movie)I want to love this movie (but only like it) because I thought it obviously have such a great potential to be ""a great movie"" on most aspects. What holds me back is the writing, story-wise.It started really strong and direct to the point which I really liked. By the next part, we'd see a little girl who follows Sunshine. At first it seems to me that it could be her inner child or her unborn future child so it confused me a bit (most especially on the part where Sunshine was rushed to the hospital, we'd see a blood on her crotch area as well). This device they used provided a bit of comic relief in the movie which I thought is cute and actually can be an effective way to delve deeper sentimentally because its so personal. However, I came to learn (through online reading) that she is indeed her unborn future child (bc of Ariana disappearing). To be honest, I couldn't finalize my thoughts on this whether I like it or not because with that in mind, the mix message does confuse some a bit on whether or not it's a ""pro-life"" but I guess that could also be the point that it is complicated. Afterall, Sunshine did kept coming back to the church scenes and this can represent a lot of women who faces/d the same situation. I just thought the movie might have to clarify in telling that message.I also much prefer her being Sunshine's inner child (which could be a ""tangible"" reminder on what the whole movie is all about, Sunshine taking control of her own life and the dream of being a national athlete ever since she's a child). But the line ""Gets ko na"" have such a great impact on people because of its ""casualness"" but its the words that has a really heavy weight on it that I thought is effective to pull people's heartstrings in. Another aspect of the movie that kinda lacked for me which is, I think a big part of it: I want to see how much Sunshine wants it by seeing her own training to be a gymnast. What does she do every day as a training athlete? How does she balance everything in her life-- being a sister/aunt/student/friend/a woman in general while also being a training athlete? What do you to do train as a gymnast? How heavy does it weigh on her that she's truly doing every thing she can to be in olympics and be a great gymnast, what does it look like? I wished she saw that a bit (even just in a montage) before or during the moment she found out she got pregnant. I want to see her really work hard and see how much blood, sweat, and tears and really feel and see that ""goddamn it i want this so bad"" and not just tell it. I guess what I want to say is that I want more training scenes too because I am also interested in watching gymnasts do their thing haha.I also thought that by the 3/4 part of the movie where we do meet Ariana is kinda took a different turn for the movie. I am not sure if it is necessary that we meet another kid (Ariana, not Mary Grace) and that maybe without that, they could still end up getting the same storyline/result (though don't get me wrong, I did like Ariana, i think she's fab). It also didn't do much impact on Sunshine's decision but rather it does prove how fucked up it is that this happen in reality and how shitty it is again that we don't have much (legal and safe, known) access to women's sexual and reproductive health services, let alone being a woman/person who's forced into something they aren't ready to be/never wanted be in the first place.More so, the visuals and cinematography, can't deny that it is beautiful, that's a given. Acting is amazing, no notes no doubt.A little predictable on emphasizing on the Manila landscape and scenery although it is still beautiful to look at (especially considering to people haven't been to Manila/Philippines, at least they'd get the gist of it even though its not all picturesque all the time). I especially appreciate the movie getting in deep and showing the grim & messy ways of taking different methods of abortion. I thought its very important to see how harrowing and fucking hard/harsh/unfair/dangerous it is that women have to/had no choice to do experiences like these. I only wished that they showed the method of when Sunshine made an appointment for that Doctor Helena because maybe it could also show that abortion could also have safe and harmless way that would make people feel less wary and scared of it and maybe even talk about it.With all that, in conclusion I think I do like this movie. It is an important movie to exists especially at our modern times, it's long overdue that we finally talk about this here in our country. I hope we keep talking about it because it is necessary for us we want to keep fighting for women's rights. I don't love it but I do like it and I appreciate it for what it did.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

davoarid,7,"More didactic than her previous films, but this is still a great “social issues” drama (albeit one with some magical realist touches), with a moving central performance. In terms of “abortion movies,” it really does a great job of making its case. For a teenage gymnast, carrying a baby to term really does completely remove that path as a possibility for her life—that dream just gets immediately destroyed, in a way that (obviously) won’t happen for the baby’s father, and it’s why it’s so essential to this film’s success that Jadaone so skillfully captures the tactile and practical *reality* of Sunshine’s body in the gymnastic scenes: that body, with its graceful and athletic movements, that she has spent her entire life molding for this sole purpose of Olympic gold, and it will go away, permanently, if she doesn’t have an abortion. I also think Jadaone does a good job of avoiding deck-stacking. Yes, the pro-life nurse who castigates Sunshine is portrayed as a witch, but the saleswoman who gives her the abortifacients is also shown to be a greedy haggler herself. And while the two male figures pressuring her to have the baby (her boyfriend and her boyfriend’s father) both make specious and insincere cases, it is again to Jadaone’s credit that she cast two dynamic male performers for these roles (Elijah Canlas and Pio Pascual—whom I didn’t recognize in a straight-up “Dad” role, after decades playing the heart-throb!)…this is one of those reviews where in the process of writing it I’ve realized I liked the movie a lot more than I thought I did while the credits were rolling.

alberttseno,7,"Yes! This is the type of films the Philippines should make more! Finally a movie with substance, relevance, and courage to tell a story despite cultural taboo. This is required and essential.I thought an hour and a half wouldn’t be enough to dig deeper into the journey of Sunshine but it was actually just enough to see all of it. Although, there were unnecessary choices made in the film that I disliked and that I wish were done differently and I wish saw more of Sunshine’s character in the lowest of lows or maybe I’m just greedy. However,Maris Racal is a revelation. And for the Philippines to have such a film like this one that speaks to so many women, even men, in the country. I hope this is a step forward for the country to move progressively and this be a force for politicians to pass that bill. Because after all, films are made to speak out, protest, and to implement change. Lastly, Sunshine is such a huge step towards good filmmaking in the Philippines.

macherieellarie,7,"Men are in fact, disappointing. And so is the society we live in.One of the biggest reasons why the Philippines’ notion of sex can be described as ‘backwards’ or ‘two-faced’ is because of the fact that it is a predominantly Catholic country that has been culturally conservative and pro-life. Many pro-life institutions and religious affiliations proliferate misinformation on reproductive health. However, the film presents this juxtaposition of vendors selling abortifacients within church grounds, a stark contrast of what Catholicism believes in. I like how this element was woven into the movie. I also like the inclusion of the unnamed girl and ‘Ariana’ into the narrative. Though at first it may be confusing, I’d like to think that those kids were the unborn children of Sunshine and the 13 year-old Mary Grace. The scene where Sunshine was practicing and the unnamed girl cheered for her, and when Sunshine asked if the unnamed girl understands her decision - this almost moved me to tears. The movie hints that the Philippines is still far from being an ideal place for women and children to live in, especially when it comes to rights pertaining to their bodies. It also serves as a haunting reminder that once a seed is planted, whichever path you may go, every path is painful. And there’s no turning back.",2025-11-27,0,0,watch,False

garulangit,7,"A Powerful Dive into Dreams and Despair​Antoinette Jadaone's ""Sunshine"" delivers a gut-wrenching, yet profoundly necessary, look at a young Filipino athlete's life derailed. The film centers on Sunshine, a dedicated and promising gymnast on the cusp of national team tryouts—her last shot at Olympic glory.​The narrative brutally shifts when she discovers she is two months pregnant. This sudden realization shatters her dreams, highlighting the devastating conflict between personal ambition and an unexpected life-altering reality.​Set against the backdrop of the Philippines, where abortion is strictly illegal, the film powerfully spotlights the immense social and legal pressures faced by women. It's a sharp social critique that exposes the isolation, judgment, and high risks inherent in navigating reproductive choices in a conservative society. The crushing weight of a lost future, compounded by moral and legal taboos, is palpable.​Ultimately, ""Sunshine"" culminates in a powerful and courageous decision made by the protagonist. This choice serves not only as a personal turning point but also as a stirring statement about resilience and taking control in a system designed to strip away agency. It’s a film that resonates long after the credits roll.",2025-11-26,0,0,watch,False

sabimosabelu,7,"It's a first step, but a step nonetheless. In a country where abortion is considered legally and morally reprehensible, it's difficult to come to terms that ""abortion = bad"" is the norm, the standard. Women are made to suffer through it and because of it, and this film portrays that perfectly.I tell myself it's a first step towards delivering more biting, more critical, and more experimental works, because while Sunshine does an A+ job of presenting the struggles and suffering women in her position experience, it's only that. A presentation, however biting and cruel and very, very real. While we follow Sunshine's story, Sunshine feels like a mouthpiece than a character. We know her dreams and what she's willing to do to achieve these dreams, and that's about it. I feel like the film tries to deliver an generalization or capsule of why women's healthcare is not prioritized in the Philippines and what the general (conservative) opinion on abortion is, instead of focusing on Sunshine as a character, a nineteen-year-old who is faced with a difficult decision and how she handles it and how she experiences it.But anyway, this isn't a film that screams abortion is no sin and that abortion should be legalized, but it's a film that talks about it and it's better than nothing.I hope we get to see more films that dare challenge the conservative, sexist, and misogynist media landscape in the Philippines.",2025-10-08,0,0,watch,False

aaronzonio,7,"Sunshine, to its very core, is the type of film we so desperately need in this country. It’s a familiar yet socially relevant narrative that aims to eventually legalise abortion and decriminalise the women facing these circumstances. Props to Jadaone for championing this narrative and actually making a change through screenings with our country’s lawmakers. The film is at its strongest when it remains simplistic. Personally, the incorporation of magical realism through the physical manifestation of these children remain counterproductive and muddied the overall tone.I wish this film had a longer runtime and room for the other repercussions and consequences in the context of being a public figure in the Philippines especially in the pursuit of becoming an Olympian. I feel like then we can truly feel her obsession and the weight of the dilemma she’s facing. My last nitpick is the cinematography. There are so many scenes that I feel needed that extra push when heavy scenes unfolded. Especially during the ribbon dancing sequences. I just wished shot selection felt more intentional in order to make each scene flow together, considering the elegance of the sport itself. Small things like these can further complement Sunshine’s love for the sport.Regardless, powerhouse performances though from the entire cast especially from Maris Racal.

reallyjohn,7,"Sucked I had to see this in a theater with poor sound proofing, occasionally overhearing the crashing sound design of Weapons playing in the next cinema. Nevertheless, it's a gripping cinematic experience with convincing performances across the board. But what stood out for me is its provoking use of the locale. Manila is so alive in this film, capturing all its noise and dirt from the restless streets of Quiapo, its sketchy motel rooms, to the crowded and understaffed hospitals. It's as if the city is actively sabotaging Sunshine's Olympic dreams. And it's not just her ambition being stolen away but also her agency as a woman. After all, it's the city that produces uncaring doctors and breeds men like Miggy and Bobot, through its misogynistic and outdated laws overwhelmed by patriarchal and religious pressures. And yet, the film never loses sight of hope. In the same rotting place, Sunshine finds hope and solidarity among other women, from her caring sister and trainer, a role-model coach, a concerned friend, a doctor willing to serve unpaid, a street vendor selling abortion pills for a cheaper price, and even from a hotel owner who does not allow solo bookings in fear they commit suicide. The idea that goodness always prevails is expected for a film like Sunshine. Otherwise, it risks being criticized as another cynical and pessimistic portrayal of our country. Empowerment is the name of the game today. Still, I find that the film's shine dims, ironically, when it avoids bleakness. Which is why I find the tonal shifts off-putting at times. The decision to physicalize Sunshine's conscience – through the inclusion of an imaginary girl who keeps following her – resulted in scenes that felt incompatible with the heavy subject matter. At one point, the guilt-turned-child is seen getting a haircut and performing gymnastics while reprimanding Sunshine. It verges into quirky territory which clashes with the established grittiness of the film that resembled Brocka's social realist drama (I know Jojo Rabbit was an inspiration but Sunshine is not purely satirical for the quirkiness to work). At worst, this plot device unconsciously validates the argument of the pro-life movement that abortion is killing lives, even if unborn. At the end, the unborn girl says she ""gets it now"" as if permitting Sunshine to eliminate her. In reality, an embryo is merely a clump of cells incapable of thinking and feeling. Granted, it's all part of Sunshine internally and subjectively dealing with her own religious trauma, but it still leaves the film with a somewhat undetermined morality. Sunshine is not murdering a kid for the Olympics. And I know the filmmakers – and most audiences – know better than to interpret the film that way, but when even influential celebrities appear to miss its progressive themes even if they were supposedly moved by the picture, perhaps it indicates to, not the incompetence of the viewers, but the film's potential to be more direct, not in an unimaginative way, but directness in political conviction. Sunshine is a bold move, but it can still be bolder. But maybe this sets a precursor for these kinds of dialogue to finally take place in our country, and actually impact policymaking. In that sense, I get it.",2025-08-14,7,2,watch,True

jmsurio_,7,"Sunshine is, by far, Jadaone's most daring—steering away from the familiar terrain of romantic drama-comedy and into one charged with grit, hope, and unflinching honesty. At its core, the film follows the uneven arc of a gymnast reclaiming her agency amid the fractures of a rigid system and her own doubts. It is not simply about sports—it is about reclaiming space in a world quick to sideline those who falter.Jadaone's decision to root the narrative in sports is a masterstroke. Athletics here is not mere backdrop but a battlefield for selfhood—a metaphorical and literal arena where gymnastics becomes a language for autonomy. Instead of reducing it to spectacle, Jadaone transforms every stretch and pivot into a political gesture—a critique of structures that discipline bodies, particularly women's, into compliance. The message is not whispered; it is delivered through the tensile beauty of bodies resisting definition.Beneath its sunlit optimism runs a current of protest. It critiques entrenched gender biases and class divides without falling into sermonizing, letting action speak louder than dialogue. When the protagonist stands firm in a world that tells her to shrink, the film achieves something rare: it politicizes persistence. And yet, it never loses its warmth. It believes in ambition as a form of defiance.While the final act feels slightly hurried—resolving arcs with a neatness that undercuts the turbulence that precedes it—the journey there is luminous. Few films manage to be both intimate and insurgent, tender yet tactical. Sunshine does. It is a film about sports, but more than that, it is about refusing to stand still when the world insists you should.",2025-08-12,0,0,watch,True
acebron,7,"better late than never, i guess.the fact that i was able to see this film three weeks after it opened in sm cinemas is a testament to the power of storytelling as a means to tackle complex topics, abortion in particular being quite meaningful in a catholic-majority country like the philippines. nearly half of the theater i was in was filled up, most being college students (since i had opted to catch this in an sm along the university belt). but the most memorable reaction i was privvy to was that of two middle-aged ladies seated a few rows behind me. during the film, one of them would occasionally mumble ""hala"" or ""naku"" at the main distressing occurrences in the narrative. given her age bracket, my preconceived notion was that these were noises of disapproval. only as we left the theater did i overhear the true intent - she told her companion ""parang si sunshine din ako dati"" and she said it not with any harrowing emotion, but casually, with a tinge of sheepishness and maybe even regret, as if it was a fact of life that took place long ago in her past and had faded into a memory tucked away in some cabinet in her mind. such is the nature of stigmatized issues like this one. jadaone's film shines when it allows the city and people of manila to reflect the truths that women encounter every day, from the closeness to religion despite its sharp edges, to the alternating concern of some strangers and quick condemnation of others. that's how sunshine breaks away from the sports movie template it begins with.but (and yes, finally, i am getting to the but) there's a certain questionable plot device used here that makes little sense. lots of other friends have said so, and i'd have to agree. personifying unborn children, to the point of dedicating a chunk of what was honestly a promising sideplot about abortion in the worst of circumstances, took away from the narrative rather than served it. there are moments where it made sense, a way to drive home sunshine's inner turmoil, but it overstayed its welcome, barely supported by the film's structure. it was a jarring choice in a story that mainly mimics social realist cinema and the thematic arcs of a sports movie (despite largely brushing over the specifics of a filipino student athlete's struggle - another flaw altogether). tl;dr: this is an ambitious work, and it could have driven home its convictions even more, if only it were not so keen to resort to choices broadly inspired by other filmmakers and sensibilities. sunshine is empowering as it is, but ultimately falls just a bit short in its vision. still, i am so, so glad it exists. maris racal was amazing.my full review(but also, take a look at mac's excellent review that takes an even deeper dive!)",2025-08-12,20,2,watch,True

It wasn't afraid to show some of the contradictions and irony of the paternalistic Filipino culture - abortion pills stands near the church, medical doctors of science who are extremely religious, future grandparents (and coach) who only really care for their own image, and so much more.Some of my female friends told me they cried while watching this. I almost did as well, but I think this film just hits different if you are a woman yourself (i blame my cis maleness). I found myself feeling for Sunshine (portrayed so convincingly by Maris) - with all the burden, shame, and guilt she had to endure, for something that she should've been able to do with her own will in the first place.I haven't heard so much swear words from a Filipino film in a while, specially most were said by little kids, but I guess it added to the harsh and cruel nature of the film (and also little kids saying curse words so brazenly are funny I guess). But I really wasn't sure what to feel with that kids plot device (which to be fair I did not fully get until much later). I felt that it takes off a bit from the realism the film was so good at, but it was very compelling for most of the scenes.I saw this here in Sydney, thousands of miles away from home, in a group of fellow Filipino immigrants. I kept thinking how the film's core issue was being received (specially if there were conservative titos and titas) but it was lowkey comforting to be around so much Pinoys again, who I'm sure the majority also watched and supported Sunshine (both the character and the film) with an open mind.",2025-08-09,0,0,watch,False

nielsnable,7,"Sunshine is a film of gestures—tender, tremulous, and at times, transcendent. Very few Filipino films dare to tackle the taboo of abortion so openly. But while it proposes itself as a daring reflection on female agency and bodily autonomy, it stops short of critically examining the material and systemic forces that make them, and being a woman in general, so perilous in the first place.The world wages war on women, and in countries like the Philippines, the battlefield is their bodies and nobody can defend them, except themselves. That's the thesis of Sunshine. But instead of grounding its story in the socio-political architecture of the Philippines—where the abortion ban preserves the state-church alliance and renders poor women's reproductive labor both exploitable and punishable—Sunshine chooses to dwell in personal emotion. Nothing inherently wrong about that, as it is just as important as the political. It actually hits very close to home, personally knowing women who have had to make these impossible choices in silence. However, the result then that we get is a film rich in atmosphere and affect but somewhat impoverished in nuance and context. We viewers are asked to infer structural violence from moody silences, bleak backdrops, and ambient dread, but the economic insecurity that shapes Sunshine's world largely remains abstract and unexplored. Her status as a decorated student-gymnast is stripped of its socioeconomic weight: no scheduling conflict, no public adulation and media scrutiny, no evidence of the extremely costly training such an elite athlete would require, no inspection whatsoever of how her athletic pursuit is ultimately tied to her material conditions, etc. We only see hints of these realities in where she lives, where she goes, and how she gets there, but the glaring absence of any meaningful insight into how she and her seemingly lower-middle-class family fund this vocation—or what hopes they've pinned to it—as well as her daily struggles as a teenager, blunt the actual stakes of her journey as a young Olympic aspirant with huge ambitions, now undermined by an unwanted pregnancy. Her abortion is framed as a personal reckoning, but the film somehow fails to convincingly connect it to her material realities. This disconnect is quite frustrating, not because the film avoids these questions entirely, but because there are attempts to address them, only to remain silent when it matters most.Antoinette Jadaone's use of magical realism then feels less like narrative innovation and more like gimmicky deflection. The film toys with the trauma of the Filipina facing an unwanted pregnancy but fully resists naming the forces that dictate it. Refusing to explicitly address even just some of the oppressive forces and structural problems that trap Sunshine—e.g., the Catholic Church's (and other powerful religious groups') political influence, the inferiority and inaccessibility of the Philippine public healthcare system, and the class dimensions of access to reproductive health—leaves its message emotionally resonant but intellectually uncommitted.Still, there are moments that land (especially Maris Racal's emotive, career-defining performance), but these fragments unfortunately can't fully compensate for a film that abstracts real-world oppression into mood, then sells that mood as meaning.In the end, Sunshine is not a failure of craft but a failure of courage. Its reluctance to take big swings is its fatal flaw. It could've been a more powerful, assertive statement. But what we're left with is a lukewarm social commentary that gestures towards discomfort but avoids naming what that discomfort is and where it stems from.I guess the public discourse and the private conversations following the release of this film are (gonna be) much more compelling than the film itself—discussions about choice, dreams, regret, and what it means to be a woman in a pseudo-progressive country like the Philippines. Perhaps this is a film that merely reopens important discussions in our society but never challenges the very status quo it tackles. But maybe that's all we need right now to start inspiring change in this country.Decriminalize abortion, here and everywhere.",2025-08-04,3,0,watch,False

poysian,7,"I was going through a study just now for a work-related task I needed to finish, and I read something that made me think of this film again: *95 percent of Filipino youth disapprove of abortion* (how do you italicize text on the browser version? anyway...) Seeing that number shouldn't be surprising to me--I went to a private Catholic school until I was twelve and I grew up in an intensely Catholic household, surrounded by adults whose overflowing devotion often spilled into violent fanaticism; I went to mass every Sunday, made sure I finished my novenas before I went to bed, brought my rosary and prayer booklets with me everyday; Catholic imagery looms throughout every stage of my life and continues to haunt me, still (even in college I had bottles of holy water sitting on the window sills of my dorm room). I *should* know that Catholicism is so deeply entrenched within our culture, and that, of course, most people would disapprove of abortion because Catholic doctrine is so integrated in our epistemological structure that it basically wires the way we think and how we understand the world. I *should* know because up until high school, I couldn't fathom how other people don't consider the fetus as a full human being. That idea was unintelligible to me. Yet the fact that *95 percent* of young Filipinos disapprove of abortion (to be clear, this number varies depending on the given context e.g., if the mother's life were at risk, more people seem to be comfortable with the idea of abortion, although overall the numbers were overwhelmingly anti-abortion) still seems unreal to me, somehow. Maybe because I thought the world has gotten significantly more progressive now than it actually is. I guess this is why the decision to personify Sunshine's fetus and depict it as a fully fleshed-out little girl seemed initially off-putting to me. I just couldn't understand why a film that seems to be pro-abortion in its overall messaging would want to insert a plot device that seems to counter or undo that messaging (not to mention tonally incongruent with the rest of the film, which is mostly gritty drama)? But it does make sense. And I understand the intention behind that choice now. I think the little girl is less of a personification of Sunshine's unborn fetus, but more of a personification of Sunshine's Catholic guilt. Throughout the film, Catholic imagery looms in the background--we see it in her home, on the jeepney, in the streets. The film captures its embeddedness in Filipino culture in a way that isn't overstated. At the same time, it also captures how embedded Catholicism is in the Filipino psyche--and perhaps in a way that is occasionally overstated. Maybe there are better ways of showing how a young Filipino woman grapples with--and eventually overcomes--her Catholic guilt as she struggles for bodily autonomy, but personifying that guilt as a stubborn child and having the woman reason with it--reluctantly, aggressively, lovingly--also works (surprisingly well). I'd also like to emphasize how well-acted this film is! Obviously, Maris is the star here, and she definitely stands out, but all the background characters hold their own, even with such minimal lines and screentime (e.g. the Quiapo vendor, the inn receptionist, Rod). My only main criticism is that the plot point involving Rhed Bustamante seems crammed into the overall story, perhaps just to drive the point further home, especially for people who are still unconvinced that Sunshine's case makes abortion justifiable. And I can understand that, but it makes the film a bit too overstuffed for me, and the addition of Ariana could have been left out completely, since it was already clear what these imaginary children were supposed to represent.

Sunod pa ay yung dinala si Rhed sa hospital dahil binuntis siya ng tito niya. 13 lang siya. Ang mga ganitong klaseng halimbawa ay pinapakita kung gaano ka-devastating yung fact na walang tulong ang narereceive ng mga kababaihan with this kind of situation.

mintygum,7,"this is a story that is close to many women’s hearts. a story that we need right now with the rise on conservatism & esp with this issue still being as taboo as it is i think more than its execution, i loved the purpose. i loved how open and real and raw it talked about issues like abortion, catholic hypocrisy, even as far as incest which is an unspoken cause for many young women’s pregnancies in this country. i loved the gritiness it depicted manila. i loved seeing all the raw emotion and thoughts that come through a young woman’s mind when it comes to an unwanted pregnancy and how sunshine navigates a very self righteous manila. i loved seeing it all from the background of a gymnast/athlete who’s stakes are so high and who u can feel this story a little more because of the pregnancy coming at the peak of her athletic career. i loved the small pockets of refuge sunshine found in various women, despite it feeling like the entire world was against her and especially coming from her sister. this movie is not without faults though. i’ll be honest, i dont necessarily know what i feel about the child consciouness/magic realism. while i appreciate annika co’s performance, it also felt jarring in such a grounded narrative. i think the story is powerful enough to stand on its own, and i was made to believe this was solely sunshine’s story but it was more of sunshine + the girl with her presence being so omnipresent. i just felt a bit like it undermines the strength of the narrative when really, the film can move past using these devices. i also think the ending didnt stick the landing as much as i had hoped. i know this film assumes its audience to be smart & im grateful for that but sometimes it felt there was too much ambiguity/left up to interpretation to fully get into the story. there was just so much more to tell here i swear!still, like what i said, im a bigger fan of its purpose than its eventual execution. theres clearly so much grit and heart put into this film that i appreciate. maris’ performance here (& jennica’s!!) is amazing, and i wish for the two to have such a long career ahead. i cried so many times, i felt my chest hurting so many times, i thought back to all the times women in my life have talked about these struggles, i went back to a time i thought i was pregnant & felt like my entire world was collapsing behind me. this is a very important and brave story and the kind that we need right now more than ever",2025-07-31,2,0,watch,False

kimmmmiko,7,"Habang nasa kalagitnaan ng pelikula, nasabi ko na lamang sa sarili ko, “Para saan ba talaga ‘tong pelikula na ‘to? Ano bang point nito?” Yun pala, ako lang ang hindi agad naka-gets.Ang fucked up lang kasi isipin kung yung bata ay literal na physical manifestation ng nasa tiyan ni Sunshine, parang anim na taong gulang na anyo ng dapat sana’y magiging anak. Mas fucked up pa kasi kinokonsensya niya si Sunshine (tinawag siyang murderer). Pero later on na-realize ko: hindi siya totoong bata, kundi visual representation lang ng internal conflict ni Sunshine. Siya yung konsensya. Siya yung maliit na boses sa loob. Siya rin si Sunshine.Kaya hindi talaga tungkol sa journey ni Sunshine sa pag-abot ng mga pangarap niya ang pelikula. Mas tungkol ito sa batang karakter—na hindi rin pala talaga bata—at sa mas malawak na karanasang pangkababaihan. Kasi sa totoo lang, ang kwento ng abortion ay hindi tungkol sa bata. Ito ay tungkol kay Sunshine. Sa mga babae. Sa mga may katawan. Sa mga may kakayahang magdesisyon para sa sarili nila.Maganda naman ang ending. Medyo parang Modess commercial nga lang (charot). Pero kung tatanungin ako, feeling ko may kulang. Bilang manonood, hindi ko gaanong naramdaman ang bigat ng emosyon. Kulang sa lalim. Kulang sa hugot. Pero nabawi naman sa pagganap ng mga aktor—walang tapon, mahusay ang lahat.Isang halimbawa ng kakulangan sa emotional connection para sa akin ay yung eksenang umiiyak si Sunshine sa loob ng inn habang isinasagawa ang abortion. Malapit na akong bumigay nun, ramdam na ramdam ko na, pero biglang nag-cut to a shot from outside the window of her emoting and yung maingay na traffic. Aesthetic, oo. Maganda, pero di ko gusto. Parang sinampal ako pabalik sa reyalidad na, “Hoy, hindi ka kasama sa kwento.” Saksi ka lang. I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t like that.Favorite scene ko siguro ay yung early scene sa pelikula, yung umiiyak si Sunshine sa jeep. Maingay sa simula, tapos unti-unting tumahimik habang nakatutok lang ang lente sa kanya. Ang galing nun. Ang ganda. In addition, siksik sa intensyon ang mga detalye—katulad ng painting sa unahan ng jeep na may nakasulat na “Gift from God.” Hala siya, eh di ikaw na ang tumanggap. (charot)Anyways, ang dami kong nasabi. Pero ngayon na lang naman ‘to. Ang galing ni Maris. At isang malaking middle finger sa mga mahilig makialam sa buhay ng iba—lalo na’t hindi naman hinihingi ang opinyon nila. Wala rin namang ambag.

Antoinette Jadaone isn’t interested in tiptoeing around which moral ground to stand on. Instead, she charges straight into the discomfort—of female bodily autonomy, of shame and silence, of what choice looks like in a country that rarely allows one.In a society still steeped in religiosity and conditioned to conflate questioning with sin, this is a film that asks: What if we made space for empathy instead?Jadaone may have just delivered her finest hour.

jimelikula,7,"Interesting na rhythmic gymnastics ang sports ni Sunshine (Maris Racal). Hindi ito kilala sa ating bansa pero kitang-kita sa sports na ito na kailangan ng marinading determinasyon at disiplina hindi lamang sa larangan ng sports dito sa Pilipinas pati na rin sa paghahanda sa paglaban sa Olympics. Kaya naman ng mabuntis si Sunshine ay naharap siya sa isang desisyong babago sa kanyang buhay at sa mga tao sa paligid niya. Ilan sa mga isyu na nilatag ng pelikula ay ang kakulangan ng sex education at accessibility ng legal abortion sa Pilipinas dahil na rin sa konserbatibong paniniwala. Idagdag pa ang kulang na suporta ng gobyerno pagdating sa ating atleta tulad na lamang sa eksenang sila pa mismo ng pamilya niya ang naghanda ng kanyang isusuot sa Olympics. Religious hypocrisy din ang kinokompronta ng pelikula tulad sa eksenang giniguilt trip ng isang sarado Katoliko na OB GYNE at muli ring pang-guilt trip sa kanya ng pastor na ama ni Miggy kay Sunshine. Si Miggy ay pastor kid na nakabuntis sa dalaga. Hindi na rin naman bago ang pagtalakay ng abortion sa Pilipinas sa pelikulang Pilipino dahil nariyan ang ""High School Scandal"" (1982) sa direksyon ni Gil Portes at ""Hinugot sa Langit"" (1985) na pinagbidahan ni Maricel Soriano at dinirek ni Ishmael Bernal. Ang kagandahan ng pelikula ay babaeng filmmaker ang lumikha at alam niya ang nadarama at pinagdadaanan mapa-pisikal, emosyonal at sikolohikal ng kapwa babae. Napakahusay ni Maris Racal sa pelikulang ito. Ang laking tulong ng cinematog kasi 'yun ang nag-set ng tone at mood ng pelikula over-all. Somewhat reminded of ""Gusto kita with all my hypothalamus"" pagdating sa cinematog.

jjmary,8,"This film is not perfect. There are some storytelling choices that made me cringed and wished to have been done in a different way. But, it is definitely human. And what i admire it for the most is its bravery to tackle something that is truly taboo in today's society---and even more so in a country that hinges a huge part of its culture in religion. The point of ""Sunshine"" is to show you the reality being faced by women who are forced into motherhood just because the church and the government refuse to budge from their self righteous ground. To show how majority of this country sees the ""unborn child"" as human, but refuse to perceive the humanness in women, especially young ones, who are being stripped of their own rights to their body. Of course, they will feel cornered, and distressed, and forced to just settle it all on their own no matter how shady and dangerous the procedure might be. Because they are deprived of healthcare support and are even shamed for going through this. The film greatly tackles the rawness of that desperation to just...fix everything.You're just sure that so many filipino household that decided to watch this had polarizing opinions about it and may even have triggered an arguement. And I am glad for that, because it means Sunshine opened doors for this taboo discussion to be brought into the table. May there many more to come.",2025-12-12,3,1,watch,False

This movie tackles such important topics in a manner that just makes sense to me.For a country that prides itself on its gender equality—the Philippines being part of the Top 20 of the Global Gap Report—it hides myriads of abhorrent secrets that goes against women. This film places a pin on just that: sex being a taboo, ostracizing of teen moms, the weightlessness of men’s actions and faults, the catholic guilt associated with abortions, and the lack of accessible healthcare. Sunshine outwardly tells the viewers that women are allowed to dream, to put theirselves first before the gripes of society. It tells us that our hypocrisy—be it in our ethics or in our religions—creates a harder world for women to live in. You, much like Sunshine’s ability to change and choose her performance’s music for the sole reason that she does not like it, have a choice in what you are and who you want to be.

The hypocrisies and contention were explored but i wished the sister played a larger role, seeing as she also went through a pregnancy and seemingly without a husband.

rashomiao,8,"i absolutely love how nuanced this is. how it took into consideration filipino contexts in discussing such a sensitive topic. i love the cinematography, absolutely stunning. captured the vibe of living in the busy and harmful streets of manila.discussed this with my gf but i find the heavy incorporation of religion in this quite integral to the story. while westerners may be able to discuss about abortion more openly, filipinos whose lives revolve around religion, are not at all the same. we were taught at an early age that religion is the absolute law, and we must follow every rule made in the name of religion. and so, the guilt sunshine carries throughout the film is heavier than ever, because not only was she dealing with the judgment of others, she was also dealing with the judgment of God, “The Father.” And, surprisingly enough, I find the presence of the child important. At first, she bothered me a bit, how she accused shine of being a murderer, stopped shine from her attempts at abortion. She’s the superego, the guilt that follows shine everywhere. But also, she’s a part of sunshine, hence her line “Pangarap ko ang pangarap niya.” (non verbatim) and so, she too, wishes to see sunshine succeed. Her running to sunshine after her final performance and saying “gets ko na” was her way of easing shine’s guilt. After all, as people love to give life to everyone’s unborn child, then I guess this once, I too, shall make use of that. Viewing sunshine’s life through the eyes of her “unborn child” must have been painful, yet every child I know has questioned (at least once) how good of a life their mother would’ve had, had they never been born. And just like every living child, the kid too, understood how much gymnastics meant to shine. And she was willing to trade the loss of her life for sunshine’s happiness, because she will always be a part of sunshine.",2025-12-07,0,0,watch,True

But surprisingly, my parents and relatives softened a bit — they're not totally against it anymore, which was a huge win.Really hoping more people can open their minds to this.

audioflicks,8,"Sunshine affected me deeply. The film explored women’s autonomy with so much honesty, and the characters’ struggles and victories felt incredibly real. I loved how it showed the layered challenges that come with unwanted pregnancies and the emotional, physical, and social weight women carry. The story treated its themes with grace and intelligence, and I truly believe it deserves a wide audience.One of the most powerful elements came from Sunshine’s relationship with her sister. Watching the difficulty of her sister’s life, especially the reality of raising a child, shaped her own decision. It felt like she saw her future in that picture, a future filled with sacrifices and dreams placed on hold. That glimpse alone said so much about choice, survival, and the pressure placed on women.The film also opened an entire landscape of conversations. Misogyny, women’s choices, abortion, body autonomy, laws, healthcare, and the quiet burdens carried by women in this country. These are everyday truths, yet they rarely reach the screen with this level of sincerity. I crave more stories with this courage, stories that explore mature themes with depth and curiosity. This film touched many important ideas and left me eager for even richer layers. Symbolism filled the entire narrative, and I loved how each detail carried emotional weight. I could spend an entire afternoon unpacking everything.One scene stays with me the most. The motel sequence. The stillness, the rumble of the train, her actions, and the aftermath created a breathtaking moment. That scene captured the danger of doing something unfamiliar to one’s body and the immense pressure created by law and religion. It felt intense, raw, and beautifully crafted.And the presence of the kid as her guilty conscience completed the emotional arc in such a striking way. It felt like a final haunting reminder of everything she carried.",2025-12-06,0,0,watch,False

I will never know what it’s like to be a woman with child but this film made me feel all the conflicted, complicated, and crushing emotions of what it’s like to make that oh so difficult decision. Yes it’s incredibly sad yet she has to make the choice that’s best for her even though it literally breaks every inch of her soul. It accurately portrays Filipino society’s perception around abortion and how religion and gender roles play an integral part in the whole ordeal when it absolutely should not. It should be between the woman and her doctor alone, the outsiders opinion only makes this life altering decision so much harder than it already is. It’s so wonderfully nuanced and so so beautiful, thank you for keeping Filipino cinema alive Sunshine.

katejumawan,8,"“Pangarap ko din mga pangarap mo, Sunshine”This movie was so beautifully written, directed and acted. Grabe, hands down kay maris kasi ramdam na ramdam mo yung emosyon niya and struggle throughout the whole movie. This literally depicts women around the philippines—-no matter what economic class they may be— when it comes to teenage pregnancy. Whether or not we care to admit it, no teenage pregnancy is planned and the toll that has on a developing woman will never ever ne experienced by ANY man. So miggy, pakyu.Pero grabe, you can feel the internal battle Sunshine was going through and I think that every single woman who has a dream, a goal in life perhaps, if situated the same, would go through the same lengths. Maybe not through all of that extent, but this is such an eye opening movie to those who still feel like abortion in the philippines is taboo. You would literally rather have all these women dying instead of getting and giving them the right medical treatment? These are children, btw. Yes, they did adult things but bear in mind that there is no such thing as a consenting child in the eyes of the law.Oh Antoinette Jadona, the woman that you are.

Banyak hal dibiarkan ambigu, tapi justru itu yang bikin interpretasinya hidup. Kita diajak ngikutin proses dia ngambil kembali kendali atas tubuh dan masa depannya, pelan-pelan, tanpa drama berlebihan. Aku merasa ada satu titik di mana semuanya terasa klik. Bukan karena dijelasin, tapi karena apa ya bisa pahamlah gitu dari caranya bersikap dan bertindak.Akhirnya juga bukan yang gimana-gimana, tapi ya kerasa personal dan melegakan.

I don't think that my incredibly sheltered memory of the place would hold as much cultural weight than that of a local, and yet fourteen years later Manila is still...Manila. And if I am brought to tears by this, I wonder about the grief carried by generations of young women failed by a dated system. In all her films, what Jadaone ultimately wants, or rather demands for her female protagonists, is Space.

I won’t give birth to this child because I’m not ready to become a mother.Abortion is illegal in the Philippines, heck even being pro-choice here is looked down upon. Yet, motherhood is an expected life trajectory for many Filipino women, that is if you marry at the “right age” and have more than 1 child at the “right time”. So what choice do women have if they are pregnant under different circumstances? For a country that claims to be collectivist (pakikipagkapwa tao mindset ang dapat pinapairal, etc.), how can this principle become a universal behavior for most when its own government continues to throw its own citizens under the bus? Every dire problem that needs to be addressed can be traced back to how fucked Filipinos are by their government. Whatever rhetoric the Spaniards spread about Filipinos being “lazy” is still used today by the rich and powerful, their basis why the Philippines continues to be poor. Galit na galit ako sa nagtitinda ng mga pekeng “gamot” para sa pagpapalaglag ng bata, the review she showed Sunshine that it was effective could possibly be fake, pero narealize ko na nagbebenta sila ng pekeng solusyon para maka ahon sa buhay (not justification of this behavior). This government continues to fail people in every aspect of life, you’d realize why the crime is so high. But is it such a crime to not want a baby? (It is not).How can Filipinos truly care for the children (whether born or unborn) when elected officials undermine reproductive health in this country, primarily women’s health. The Reproductive Health Law faced a long legislative battle just to get passed, and it still took two years for the law to be fully accessible for the public. When your prospects are so thin, people will do anything to get what they want, even if it costs their life. That is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of Filipinos. At the end of the day, Filipinos are treated as just mere statistics in politics.",2025-12-05,2,0,watch,False

louiese,8,"this is a film that shows several harsh realities that many young women face every day. it tackles sensitive yet crucial issues such as unplanned pregnancy, illegal abortion, sexual assault committed by a family member, the heavy influence of religion on decision-making, and how one snap can completely shatter a young person’s future. these themes are not exaggerated; they are painful and real. “Mahirap maging babae, mas lalo na babae sa Pilipinas.”the film drop a reality line about women especially here in the philippines. this resonates the lived experiences of countless young women who grew up navigating a society that often blames them first before offering help.the movie also embodied the noises—the noise of judgment from society, the noise of broken dreams, and the noise coming from people who desperately need help but have nowhere to turn. it speaks out that the loudest sound isn’t the chaos of Manila’s streets, but the silent cries of countless helpless women. the film exposes the flaws in our cultural, social, and institutional systems, making it easy to see where we are lacking the most.the scene showing the overcrowded OB department in a public hospital was somehow alarming. it’s chaotic, understaffed, and overcrowded—yet this reflects reality. it reveals how instead of creating long-term solutions, government tend to simply acknowledge the issue or, worse, disregard it. the systems remain weak and unresponsive.beyond all of these social issues, the film also shows how dreams can easily collapse under the weight of societal pressure. this makes the film more than just a film—it becomes a moviefied reflection of the everyday struggles of filipino youth, especially young women who are forced to grow up too fast.overall, the movie sunshine is a wake-up call. it’s a call for empathy, understanding, and meaningful change.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

melthing,8,"Sunshine is a feat for Philippine cinema. It tackles a topic most are scared to produce and it was written WELL. Yes, without the poverty porn or political porn most films of ours subtexts. There are characters that are REAL. Not written to tell unjustly-unrelated issues but to support the story itself. And so, characters that are in poverty aren’t written to convey another message, rather to stand with what the film is about in the first place. This film is easily the one of the best written films of all time in our history. Not only does it tell a beautiful picture of a character undergoing such a life-turning “accident” but how it tells it psychologically, and powerfully. It never let go of what it portrays nor does it settle for a scene that would bring in viewers, it’s written SO realistically that you’d forget it’s a movie. A quick one to point out is Sunshine texting her bestfriend, at the time she needs support the most, even if she’s disappointed for losing contact with her, she still texts out of fear, and that’s something i’m sure plenty of people have done. Those text messages are so real, raw and incredibly well-written too. The whole story is an absolute masterclass of writing a film straightforwardly without losing the essence of what it is. It’s a display of perfect world-building, from the story of her boyfriend, the realistic response from him to the story of the tindera, who without building a relationship, completely makes sense of the film. Even built a subtext of a no nonsense coach that adds to fear, support, motive and regret of the main character.I can tell you all about the beautiful writing but this would be too long. Let’s get to the cinematography. Well, it’s good. Definitely better than most films, it’s quite obvious that certain camera works and shots aren’t just to finish the scene but is chosen to look good while portraying a scene nicely. There’s a lot of cues that whispers visually, like how she prays with bars infront of her, evoking the feeling of our character not FEELING or BEING welcome inside the church. Shot-selections like those sre essential and quite reliable to make a scene impactful so i’m incredibly proud they excerted better effort to make this film the best it could possibly be. Wouldn’t say it’s a strong suit, but this fil is definitely visually well-made.I’ve always seen Maris Racal as a great actress before this, now she’s PHENOMENAL one and is one of the best in the industry right now. The talent to portray talent and skill alone, is something most actors/actresses not only have the chance to audition for BUT absolutely nails from the first to the last second of the film. There’s a Piolo Pascual jumpscare here, Elijah Canlas KILLS it AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.Sunshine is great, it’s amazingly told through emotions and a bit of a psychologically present engagement to allow interpretations of viewers be as wide as it can.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

raven_hoodie,8,"One of the biggest factors holding back the Philippines from being as progressive as our neighboring countries like China and Japan is our deep entanglement with religion—Christianity, in particular. As much as faith shapes our culture, it also becomes a hindrance to national progress when religious beliefs are imposed on matters that should prioritize the welfare and rights of all citizens. Imagine how much better our society could be if we allowed personal freedoms and evidence-based policies to guide our decisions, instead of insisting on religious doctrine as the standard for everyone.The movie portrayed this reality so powerfully. It addressed so many issues in one narrative—how women are often the ones who suffer the most under a misogynistic system, how men can easily walk away from responsibilities while women cannot, and how horrifying it is that young girls, even minors, can be raped and then forced to bear a child. These are the consequences of a society that refuses to give women full autonomy over their own bodies.I truly hope more people come to realize the importance of allowing women to make decisions for themselves by legalizing abortion. Every woman deserves the right to choose what happens to her own body.Despite the heaviness of the story, I’m glad that Sunshine still managed to pursue the dream she longed for, proving that resilience can still bloom even in the harshest circumstances.",2025-12-04,0,0,watch,False

Unsafe abortion practices, severely misinformed women, archaic religious politics; there are so many wrongs in this country that make it harder for women to live. Sunshine is a movie that reflects how people and women in this country view abortion. This is evident in the imaginative character of the kid that Sunshine interacts with, which is her possible daughter in the future if she chooses to proceed with her pregnancy. In the ending, we get an assuring “gets ko na” which might have been what Sunshine needed to hear regardless if the child was real or not. I think this is an example of how we Filipinos view the nature of abortion, needing a verbal agreement from an unborn person before terminating. I’m not saying this is a bad thing, don't get me wrong, but I think it is an interesting portrayal of catharsis that Filipinos would resonate to. And it seems like it did.

vicsvaporub,8,"this feels very similar to brocka in that it portrays manila as a city full of hardship and loneliness that can leave you so disillusioned and alienated; and where hope and humanity exist on the fringes of it. it's a working-class story with working-class sentiments that fully takes on its own identity because jadaone is able to portray such familar elements in a way that feel completely isolating; the interiors of jeepneys, tricycles, shabby motels, clinics — everything feels so alien. which, i guess, offers many people unfamiliar with what these woman go through a much-needed perspective on the importance of dignity and bodily autonomy and how violent, horrible men try to take that away from many women.i think it's also worth noting that religion and patriarchy play such a prominent role here in oppression; jadaone laser-focused on placing religious beliefs and preconceived notions about abortion in the spotlight, all the more affected by teenage pregnancy and how religion has kind of shaped the way many filipinos treat abortion as something so taboo and inhuman that they completely forget how it affects the mother. and it's brought to life by a really incredible maris racal; shaped by all the adversity — the kind of performance that requires you to bare your soul to the audience, to beg them to see the humanity behind the people suffering from religious oppression, and why access to abortion services — even in a heavily catholic country — is of utmost importance.",2025-12-03,1,0,watch,True

letshencook,8,"It was true when they said that this was a brave film. To be one of the first films in pinoy cinema to explore a pro-choice and an unwanted pregnancy narrative is indeed brave, especially when you know the Philippines’ socio-political and religious climate around topics regarding sex, female desires, pregnancy, bodily autonomy, and parenthood.There were unfortunately some parts of the film that felt like they didn’t work.I’m not sure but Sunshine’s decision to abort felt too quick. And her dream to be an Olympian felt underexplored and more of her coach’s. We’re told rather than shown that it was hers.The inclusion of Annika Co whose character can be interpreted as Sunshine’s subconscious/ego or unborn child or whatnot sometimes felt irritating to watch (sorry not sorry). But I guess to reach more towards a predominantly Filipino audience and to highlight Sunshine still being a (teen) child who’s forced to confront the consequences of her choices by a child: worked? I don’t know. Not to mention that it felt a little silly to include two other characters, where one was another pregnant teen girl, that lowkey felt like their stories were being shoved down to the audience’s throats. And in the end, felt shallow. I just think that I hoped they showed more of the technicalities of her being an athlete. Rhythmic gymnastics is considered an elite sport. And when you consider it in the Philippine context – the film didn’t really show what was at stake of being an athlete in this sport. The film’s strong aspects are definitely on the score, cinematography (particularly to highlight the corners of Manila as this chaotic, packed, and cruel city), and of course: Maris’ performance as Sunshine. There were scenes that hit hard and heavy. The irony of abortion drugs sold and found in the street outside a church. The motel scene to show Sunshine’s quiet desperation. Her final rehearsal for her routine before her “gets ko na” scene with Annika (where I cried unfort bcz luteal phase duh).The film does show you a glimpse of the unforgiving reality of what many Filipino women go through everyday: teenage pregnancy, overcrowded and underfunded public hospitals, and the lack of comprehensive sexuality education about sexuality and sexual and reproductive health. It lacked, sure. But I guess, for pinoy cinema to start tackling difficult topics such as this: it’s a start.",2025-12-02,1,0,watch,False

forgetlilacw,8,"This is a blistering, gut-punching film that doesn’t just ask difficult questions about bodily autonomy and Olympic dreams; it screams them into the humid, chaotic reality of Manila. It’s a brave, essential piece of cinema that confronts the devastating consequences of living in a country where a woman’s control over her own body is perpetually under threat. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and utterly visceral—it’s relentless, trapping us inside Sunshine’s suffocating anxiety. Jadaone uses the oppressive visual texture of Quiapo’s crowded, sweltering streets—a perfect, gritty backdrop—to symbolize the labyrinthine journey of a young woman navigating impossible choices in a system designed to fail her.A massive and well-deserved standing ovation goes to the central performances. Maris Racal is devastating as the titular gymnast, embodying the crushing physical and emotional burden with every strained muscle and every desperate, silent plea. Her performance is a masterclass in controlled despair, capturing the agony of a lifetime of sacrifice being threatened in an instant. She is perfectly complemented by Annika Co’s mesmerizing, eerie, and unrelenting presence as the Kid—an unsettling narrative device that functions as both Sunshine’s internal critic and her desperate conscience. But let’s be real: the film’s rawest emotional hook comes from the shocking failure and apathy of the men around her. Their irresponsibility and sheer lack of accountability form a central, infuriating symbol of the patriarchal society that traps Sunshine.Ang hirap maging babae sa Pilipinas. Every day feels like a battle against a society na paulit-ulit kang nilalagay sa kahon, insisting that your worth begins and ends with motherhood. Fuck the stigma na finoforce ang mga kababaihan into roles they never agreed to—parang automatic default na lang na dapat tahimik, dapat magtiis, dapat magpakamartir. Walang puwang para sa sariling pangarap, sariling katawan, sariling desisyon.Kaya sana mas umingay at mas mapag-usapan ang Reproductive Rights—hindi lang as a “women’s issue” but as a basic human right. This is about giving women the freedom to choose, the safety to seek care without judgment, and the dignity to exist without being shamed or controlled. Hanggang hindi natin tinatalakay nang seryoso ang mga ito, paulit-ulit lang tayo sa cycle ng stigma, trauma, at kawalan ng choices.Being a woman here shouldn't feel like a punishment. It shouldn't demand silence in exchange for survival.

The story is simple, sometimes too simple, no room for nuance and reading between the lines - and one device it uses feels overused (until that end scene). But it’s the kind of movie Philippine cinema needs. One that sheds light on a societal issue and gets conversations going. Jadoane’s Manila is tragically beautiful and beautifully tragic at the same time, bleeding with so much color, effervescence, but doesn’t lose its danger and darkness in every street corner. But the heart of Sunshine is Racal’s performance, showing us this is more than just the “abortion” film, but one that empathizes the plight of most Filipino women on what it’s like to grow up and live in a society that doesn’t care about you or your struggle.

As someone working in the healthcare field, I believe the movie highlights an important truth: abortion should not be treated as a taboo subject or inherently immoral. Whether we acknowledge it or not, there are women who do not wish to become pregnant or are not ready to become mothers. Criminalizing abortion does not stop it from happening; it merely drives women toward unsafe procedures that place their lives at greater risk.If one personally identifies as pro-life, then one has the choice not to pursue abortion. However, holding that belief does not grant anyone the authority to dictate or restrict what women can do with their own bodies, especially when they do not contribute to the wellbeing of the child these women may be forced to bear. The health, autonomy, and safety of women must remain our priority. It is time to end the stigma surrounding reproductive choices and to uphold the separation of religion and state in policymaking.",2025-12-01,0,0,watch,False

nelletella,8,"”Ay nako! Talaga naman ang mga kabataan ngayon hindi na makapagpigil.”Throughout Sunshine, there are several adult figures that do not listen to Sunshine, blinded by either their convictions or Filipino societal norms. They push Sunshine on what she must do: pray, seek forgiveness, give the baby a life, be a mom, and pray. In the adults’ eyes, Sunshine is not a nineteen-year-old Filipina in Manila going to school and practice. To the adults, Sunshine is already a mom.On Saturday, the Filipino noontime show It’s Showtime invited parents with 7 or more children for their game Laro, Laro, Pick. A majority of the contestants were women, and two of the mothers interviewed, Elsa and Rosalie, had 15 and 8 children respectively. Elsa, the 63-year-old woman with 12 living children and 3 deceased children recited the ages of her 12 children from the oldest, 46, to the youngest, 24. The gap between the older ones is 1-2 years apart, while the younger ones are about 2-3 years apart. Elsa confesses how difficult life is for her and her children, spouting how without God she would not be as strong as she is today, living off 300 pesos everyday. When Vice Ganda asked Elsa why she has so many children, Elsa plainly said, “Ehhh di ako marunong mag family planning eh,” inciting some laughter in the audience. Elsa even revealed that the father was absent and had a different family, leaving the Filipina mother and her 12 living children to figure out how to live.The second woman, Rosalie, with 8 children echoed the same sentiments as Elsa. She sells sampaguita every day with no days off at the age of 60 something; her children married and had their children early; the highest level of schooling one of her children attained was high school, but never graduated; her children sell sampaguita with no days off; and she has 19 grandchildren to look after in a home with no roof above their heads.What Sunshine, Elsa, and Rosalie have in common is how the patriarchy confines them to suffocating religious ideals, a corrupt and conservative government, and poor healthcare. What Sunshine does not have in common with the two women is the ignorance in family planning. Sunshine is no one's mother! It should never be a reason to have 7 or more children at an early age, with no means of support financially and emotionally, because it is ""God's gift,"" or because they simply want to experience having children. The favorite catchphrase, ""Kase malakas ako, kaya ko to"" can only thrive for so long with honesty until oppressors abuse the Filipina determination. Access to sexual education MUST be a right, not a privilege nor a taboo subject. Children do not decide when they want to be born, so there should be conscious efforts to assess if the environment people live in can secure their children's/childrens' future(s), especially in a country like the Philippines. Unfortunately, there are connections to poverty and the lack of interest and access to proper education. There is also the inability for Filipinos in poverty to seek other options, or have the real agency to pursue aspirations. While there is such thing as being irresponsible, Filipino women are a laughingstock in conversations surrounding teen pregnancy and reproductive rights—when realistically—they should have the choice to protect themselves, but are instead ruthlessly flayed off by the very system that commands kindness.[Minor spoilers ahead]Annika Co manifests herself as (what I think) Sunshine's Catholic guilt. We first meet Annika after Sunshine prays outside of Quiapo Church and is about to light a cigarette. Annika appears whenever Sunshine does something that will affect the fetus, and often berates Sunshine for being ""bad."" At first, I was hesitant towards the idea of Annika representing Sunshine's potential child, because it can mistakenly support the pro-life argument of murder (which Annika actually yells at Sunshine), until Annika says, ""ang pangarap ko ay pangarap niya."" SOBRANG bigat yung line na yan! In a sense, Sunshine and Annika are the same person. Sunshine should be able to pursue her dreams successfully the same way Annika, along with other living and future children, should feel secure enough to be ambitious. The message further builds itself with Ariana, Annika's friend and the 13-year-old girl's potential child. Ariana wants to be the first gay president, but how can they do that in an environment with a r*pist, a neglectful grandmother, and a KID whose choice was stolen?If mothers like Elsa and Rosalie can somehow ""get away"" with no family planning, how can Sunshine and the 13-year-old girl survive in a Catholic Philippines? The Reproductive Health Law was passed in December 2012, and efforts to educate the masses and distribute contraceptives have improved, yet there is still a high percentage of unintended pregnancies, AIDS rates, and JUSKO PO—ISSUES WITH BUDGETING (source 1),(source 2) !!!!!! The Philippines will never progress as a nation if objectivity is blocked by the grip the church and the state have on one another, which ultimately and consistently harms Filipinas who give their best yesterday, today, and tomorrow.I am certain that Sunshine is not the first film to be unapologetically bold and loud for the Filipina, but it is certainly the first to make rounds among the casual movie-goers and the general Filipino. It is not a perfect film and such flawed instances are where:- the narrative of Sunshine being an Olympic-level athlete clashes with the lack of popularity shown outside of practice- the cinematography is poetic without a doubt, but the scenes of Sunshine messaging her Coach, Miggy, and Thea isn't synchronized with Sunshine typing on the phone/isn't even her actually texting. If you're going to place emphasis on the quietest scenes, I believe that something as minor as texting should be clean (this was the same quip I had with the controller scene in Anora like c'mon now....)- the cinematography can be too poetic. for example, the shot of Sunshine looking out of her hotel window with the Metro Manila noise juxtaposing her quiet turmoil contributes to Sunshine purposely not drowning out the noise (or the failure to?), but I found it unnecessary because right after she woke up in pain. the juxtaposition felt like it was purely for aesthetics- the Jojo Rabbit esque character of Annika and Ariana was VERY risky (re: pro-life arguments)- maybe it's just me but the film gives you some breathers with comedic aspects in things like ""no bad words"" and Annika proceeding to say ""putangina"" which I found myself like ""damn girl ! ! !"" though it makes me wonder if those who do not share the same ideals as me laughed at it the same way the audience laughed at Elsa in Laro Laro Pick. In a not long-winding way, and assuming negatively, if tonal shifts struck the audience as a serious matter and not a reactionary narrative.- the last 3 paragraphs of this review regarding how art can effectively stand by its purposeAng hirap maging isang Sunshine sa Pilipinas, at hindi pinaguusapan kahit eto ang reality ng karamihan ng babae at batang babae. Women can dream for themselves. Women can learn to protect for themselves if there are resources available by sources that make themselves available. Women are strong, but you cannot glorify them to always be strong at the expense of exploitation. Sunshine is many of the first steps in Philippine cinema that can continue the conversation. I hope the film incites action in Filipinos to call out the current and future administration, who, under the guise of a devotee to a forgiving religion, perpetuates being uncritical and whose laziness is a disservice to the Filipino people. And most importantly, may Filipinos denounce the administration's vigor in committing violence against them, and reclaim the autonomy all Filipinos are born with.",2025-11-30,2,0,watch,True

iameelle,8,"loveee the solidarity of women in the film. especially jeannica's character (sunshine's sister) 😔what stood out to me abt “Sunshine” is how it handles abortion without turning it into shock value or moral debate. the film treats it the way real life does, quietly, privately, and w a kind of heaviness that doesn’t need big explanations. it shows how a situation like this doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it’s shaped by family, religion, money, expectations, fear, and the silence surrounding women’s choices, seeing how, in the film, women were denied healthcare even in life or death situations bc of the values and systems upheld in this country.motherhood demands so much, money, energy, time, and an immeasurable amount of emotional labor. once u step into it, there's no turning back. that's why becoming a mother should never be forced, it's not something anyone should bepushed into. it's not easy to be one.being a mother is a beautiful, yet deeply complex role. it should be intentional, it should be a choice.at the same time, every person brought into this world deserves to be born out of intention, love, and readiness. if someone doesn't want to become a mother, that's OKAY. it's only fair, both to her, and to the life she could've been expected to bring into the world.the movie doesn’t try to justify anything or convince u what is right. instead, it shows the reality of how young people end up dealing w choices they were never prepared for. it’s not dramatic, not preachy, just painfully honest. the long pauses, the still shots, the way conversations trail off… it all reflects how hard it is to say something out loud when yk u’ll be judged before u’re understood.it’s thoughtful, grounded, and uncomfortable in a necessary way. a reminder that behind every headline or opinion is someone trying to figure out how to move forward when every option hurts.",2025-11-30,1,0,watch,False

The talent of our Filipino directors, writers, and actors is flourishing; it just needs the right hand managing them. Studios surrounding Sunshine took a huge gamble promoting and marketing this movie, because they know how good it is. And it's that fcking good!Sunshine beautifully captures Sunshine, our protagonist, as she battles her way out of an unwanted pregnancy set in the cold city of Manila. This journey was documented with captivating visuals of Sunshine in the gym, in Quiapo, in a motel, etc. On top of this, this is unlike any other dialogue in mainstream Pinoy. The dialogue often has witty layers, purposeful intentions, and emotional punches.Maris Racal delivered a career-defining performance. This is not the same Maris Racal we often see in teleseryes or some other romcom movie. Her performance is an incredible take on such a complex and relatable character.I could nitpick some off details here and there which really bugged me, but I won't talk about it here as I believe that further magnifying this movie's success is what we should do.Sunshine represents every woman, every female, every girl, every lady of any shape or form. It brings up socially relevant topics and issues worthy of discussion. I am most impressed by its bravery to speak all about these, coming from a conservative country.

julyuhna,8,"“Drown out the noise. You are Sunshine.”it’s heartbreaking how many young women are going through this right now. abortion in the Philippines is not only illegal, but also so deeply stigmatized that many are forced to carry this burden alone, sometimes risking their own lives through unsafe procedures. the film portrays this reality with such quiet honesty that it sticks with you. the symbolism throughout was also so striking, like the “Gift of God” sign in the jeepney Sunshine rode, or her so-called imaginary friend who could represent her unborn child or her inner child.it was honestly so satisfying watching her stand up for herself against miggy and his father, who’s a pastor. then of course, her breaking the bottle on tito bobot’s head? deserved. every mf like him deserves that.the final sequence felt incredibly freeing as well. it was like she was finally free, almost like a release of everything she had been carrying — fear, shame, pressure, expectation. her imaginary friend disappearing can be interpreted that she did push through with the abortion (which parallels the 13 y/o kid and ariana), or as her finally finding peace with whatever choice she made. hopefully, this film gives conservatives some perspective on the immense weight placed on women in these situations, and they’ll finally be able to say, “Gets ko na.” not everyone has the means to raise a child, especially when society is quick to judge. and even if you do have the means, you might simply not be ready because you might still have dreams you want to chase. it’s really tough, and that’s why kindness matters so much.at the end of the day, we shouldn’t be the ones deciding what women should do with their bodies. and yeah, practice safe sex!!",2025-11-30,0,0,watch,True

colecoded,8,"I hesitated to write a review that delves into the realities women in our country face, because I’m not the person who should be speaking for them.But SUNSHINE is a deeply powerful film.It would’ve been easy for a story like this to sink into pure despair from beginning to end. Yet somehow, the film manages to confront its darkest truths while still carving out a sliver of hope. The performances are extraordinary—raw, fearless, and honest—but they make the film difficult to watch in the best possible way. It exposes how our country refuses to grow, medicine needed for the operation coming from black markets, how it continues to force women into roles far smaller than what they’re capable of, and how it avoids addressing issues that desperately need to be talked about. Women deserve choice. They deserve agency. They deserve that right without question.This film places you in the shoes of a woman who believes her life has been shattered by one reckless decision made by someone she trusted—and then shows, unflinchingly, how our society treats victims.Hopefully, the success of this film reignites the conversation around the importance of being pro-choice and pushes us toward building a better, more humane system.All we hope for is a little sunshine to finally break through.",2025-11-30,1,0,watch,True

makimakkk,8,"hindi ko alam kung anong mas mabigat habang pinapanood ko Sunshine — yung katahimikan ng mga babaeng walang mapagsabihan, o yung ingay ng mundong ang bilis humusga pero ang bagal tumulong. Jadaone films always stab softly, pero ito? Parang dahan-dahang hinihiwa yung dibdib, layer by layer, para ipakita yung takot, pangarap, at kahihiyang matagal nang nakatago sa ilalim ng “ok lang ako.”this is the kind of film na hindi mo papanoorin para gumaan ang loob mo, papanoorin mo siya para maalala kung gaano kabigat mabuhay bilang babae sa bansang ayaw umamin na may mali sa sistemang sinasamba nito. Sunshine doesn’t preach. it just stands there, raw and trembling, asking the kind of questions we’re trained to avoid:Paano ka pipili kung lahat ng choice mo ay kasalanan sa mata ng iba?Paano ka lalaban kung mismong katawan mo ang pinaparusahan?Maris Racal is devastating in ways na hindi loud pero lumalalim. hindi siya yung tipikal na dramatic heroine — she’s simply a girl suspended between a dream and a reality that keeps shrinking her choices. her silence says more than any monologue could. every frame feels like a confession: hesitant, trembling, pero totoo.and what struck me most wasn’t the gymnastics, or even the central issue of abortion. it was the ache between who we want to become and what our circumstances force us to be. nakakapagod maging babae sa Pilipinas — laging may moral lesson, laging monitored, laging may takot na isang maling galaw lang, tapos na ang lahat. parang ang liit liit ng mundo mo kahit ang laki laki ng pangarap mo.Sunshine doesn’t romanticize any of this. walang sermon, walang cinematic gloss. just a raw, unfiltered look at how dreams bruise under a society na mas mabilis manghusga kaysa umintindi. the film’s imperfections — the loose ends, the uneven metaphors, the sometimes rushed stakes — oddly work in its favor. because real life isn’t clean. hindi linear ang trauma. hindi laging malinaw ang choice. and maybe that’s the point: that we’re all navigating a world built not on empathy, but on fear and control.in the end, Sunshine feels less like a movie and more like a mirror — one that forces you to sit with the darkness until you finally admit na masakit talaga ang liwanag. it’s an eye-opener not because it shocks, but because it whispers truths we’ve mastered the art of ignoring.a film worth watching, not because it entertains, but because it confronts. because it nudges you to look beyond the screen and into the world we built… and ask, Bakit ganito?And more importantly — hanggang kailan?",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,False

astrocampo,8,"One thing I like about Sunshine is its brazen risk to center the story on a 19-year old who's made consequentially irresponsible choices. It's a gambit that can easily be -- and, judging by discussions surrounding this movie, has already been -- misconstrued as a lesson on the importance of hammering down our society's puritanical views on sex and reproductive health to set teenage girls straight. That, somehow, Sunshine is a lesson in, as the elders say, ""opening your legs for just about anybody""; that she did not listen to the adage is an absolute failing on her part, and its consequences fall rightfully on her shoulders. But here's the tricky bit: Sunshine could very well have been about a mother who could no longer give birth to another, and it would have still been met with the same logic-defying resistance that still places the blame squarely on the woman. Minor gripes include a finicky plot device that, at times, feels jarring and slightly questionable in terms of messaging. But it all feels egregious to say because the urgency of its existence really dwarfs over whatever minor flaws it may have. It also helps that Sunshine carried is so deftly by Maris Racal's and Jennica Garcia's career-defining performances, and a score by Rico Blanco that knows how to restrain and reintroduce itself in all the right moments.Sunshine cracks open a conversation on an obstinately immovable subject, and unflinchingly exposes the grim reality on how our women and girls move about our society, bearing the problems that we could easily find solutions to but which our religious guilt and intolerance constantly shame us into denying.",2025-11-29,0,0,watch,True

y2krzl,8,"Rewatched it and still felt underwhelmed. The trailer was so promising and I expected a lot. I’m all for it from what they’re trying to convey but the storytelling wasn’t it. Execution is realistic tho.

Love the irony, the symbolism, and the heats.But then again, they be trying to highlight everything all at once but failed to deliver why we’re here in the first place. It was moving, as a woman. BUT AS A WOMAN I was hoping for a more impactful message since it opened a lot of discourse. Women are far more complex and I was looking for chaos in what a woman feels in a society where everyone are so entitled to decide on how a woman should act and carry themselves. The movie could’ve gone deeper, one that touches diff range of emotions. It just doesn’t feel genuine, yk.Overall, Im giving it 4 stars.

filoconnoisseur,8,"In spite of her past controversies, Maris Racal's performance in this film is the very reason why she remains in the spotlight. Her acting as Sunshine is spectacular. The story requires someone who is capable of letting the viewers feel the heaviness of her pain, the agony, and the hope of standing up for yourself and for what you want, and she made us feel all of that. And though I may not completely agree with everything that's pointed out here, I really admire Jadaone's attempt and bravery at addressing such a taboo topic, not just in the Philippines but the rest of the world. Being prayerful and always going to church do not give us the right to see ourselves as being more morally upright than others. When you put all of that aside, Sunshine is just a teenager who regretfully made a mistake and who made a decision for herself, stood up for what she wanted, and spared the child from the resentment of a mom from being robbed of her own dreams, and of leading her to what could possibly be a miserable life.She knows she could be ridiculed for that decision, but she lived according to her own terms anyway.

samdotmov,8,"Kudos to Direk Tonet, Maris Racal, and the whole team responsible for creating this film, thank you for being brave and casting a light on our nation’s issues often overlooked in fear of the cultural taboo it carries. I would have rated it 5 stars, but the choice to represent Sunshine’s internal conflict with herself through a hallucinated child character doesn’t sit right with me. Jadaone’s direction results in jarring tonal shifts that muddle the film’s emotional center. What was perhaps intended as a bold attempt at cinematic expression to illustrate inner turmoil instead dilutes the stakes, softening the thorniness of the subject matter with a cartoonish detour. It’s an interesting idea but one that never quite coheres with the rest of the film’s pro-choice sensibility. In fact, by personifying an unborn child as a character which speaks and thinks, then Sunshine unintentionally reinforces the very moral framing that anti-abortion rhetoric thrives on. It circles back into the age-old “when does life begin?” debate—a question that continues to paralyze policymaking in the country, even when the conversation should be about autonomy, access, and proper healthcare. The film doesn’t just inherit this moral hang-up; it stages it, frames it, and in doing so, muddies the clarity of its own politics. Though, I will still give my flowers to this movie. It helped brought upon a conversation in our country long overdue and for that I am grateful. I hope it inspires other filmmakers to be bold in the face of a country that chooses to be blind to issues that continue to grow with no solutions in sight.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,False

jmosatalla14,8,"What will you do if your dream is at stake because of one mistake?Sunshine delivers a powerful message about reproductive rights and the need for access to safe and legal abortion.The film shows the current state of healthcare in the Philippines and how this basic necessity has become inaccessible, especially to those living below the poverty line.I like how the film does not romanticize the societal issue of unwanted pregnancy. Instead, it highlights how stigma deeply affects women’s decision-making about their own bodies. It shows how the main character struggles with an internal conflict and debates with her own conscience.While the film clearly presents why abortion should be legalized and recognized as part of healthcare in the Philippines, it also portrays how religion and health often clash. It is true that our country is still in the process of accepting that abortion is a right that should be available to all women.Some might argue that safe sex is the only way to avoid these situations, but we cannot ignore the fact that many women experience sexual abuse, rape, or non-consensual ejaculation during intercourse.Sunshine is not just a film that explains why safe abortion should be legalized; it calls our attention to consider the issue without guilt-tripping women through religion or societal pressure.Women should have the freedom to decide what to do with their own bodies. Marriage or co-parenting should not be treated as a band-aid solution to a lifelong responsibility. These solutions do not apply to everyone, especially to those who do not have the means to support a child.I know we all have different perspectives on this issue, but thinking long-term about the future of our children depends on how ready we truly are to take on this responsibility.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,False

chocopaolover,8,"if there is light, kahit konting-konti lang, we chase it—because sometimes that’s the only thing left for women to hold.sunshine (2025) is the kind of film na hindi ka pinapa-wow sa effects or spectacle. instead, it sits beside you quietly, like a friend na alam lahat ng pagod mo kahit hindi mo sinabi. it’s woman-centered in the most unsettling, honest way—walang sugarcoating, walang mythologizing, just the raw truth of being a girl in a country that asks you to endure more than it ever protects.the film strips away the usual softness associated with its title. sunshine isn’t light; she’s a girl trying to survive a world that keeps dimming her. and when the story touches the issue of abortion not being legalized in the Philippines, it doesn’t sensationalize it—pinapakita lang niya ‘yung totoo: na in this country, women are expected to carry consequences alone. that reproductive rights become moral battles instead of health and safety; na the system treats our pain like an inconvenience, our choices like crimes.‘yung internal struggle ni Sunshine—‘yung fear, guilt, confusion, desperation—hindi dahil “mahina siya,” but because society makes women feel cornered by circumstances we never chose. and the film doesn’t villainize her for thinking about her future; it villainizes the world that forces her to justify wanting one.and then there’s Miggy.Miggy is… familiar. not evil, not abusive, just painfully typical. he represents the kind of boyfriend most girls in the philippines know too well—the one who “cares,” but only until it requires accountability. the boy who says “I’m here for you” pero umiilag sa big conversations. the boy who loves you but doesn’t understand the weight you carry because he’s never had to carry anything like it.Miggy is the embodiment of how boys in this country are raised: may freedom without consequence, may opinion without knowledge, may presence without responsibility. his reactions, his avoidance, even his attempts to comfort—they feel real because they’re exactly what so many girls have lived through. boys who think support is just saying “kaya natin ’to” while leaving the actual pain to us.sunshine 2025 becomes a commentary on how women are taught to be accountable for everything—including mistakes that weren’t only theirs—while men are taught to be forgiven for everything. the movie doesn’t hate Miggy; it exposes him. it shows the casualness of male privilege, the way it slips into daily life unnoticed but heavy—always heavy—on our side.and that’s what makes the film hit: it’s not loud, not preachy, not dramatic. it just shows the truth—and the truth is already loud enough.sunshine isn’t a story about brightness; it’s a story about women trying to navigate a world that refuses to make space for their choices, their fears, their bodies, their futures. it’s a film that says:the pain wasn’t yours alone, but somehow, you were the only one expected to carry it.and long after the credits, you’re left with that hurt—the kind that reminds you why we keep fighting for a world where women don’t have to beg for the right to their own lives.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,True

Oo nga no’, women are always influenced if not forced to continue the pregnancy without asking them what they want just because society views abortion as “illegal” and religiously wrong.

In the case that abortion can be abused, like aborting female-gendered fetuses. That can easily be regulated IDK how yet, but it’s possible.Women are more affected than men. The latter can easily opt out of it simply because they will not be the ones to carry the baby.

zrn_xyz,8,"I don’t usually leave reviews, but Sunshine stood out to me as such a critically significant piece in filipino cinema especially in a culture rooted in colonialism and christianity. I love how manila is depicted in its rawest form. Maingay, magulo, heck you could even smell it from the screen. It does not romanticize the city nor flatten it into a mere backdrop. The theme of Sunshine is something we rarely see portrayed in filipino cinema. It doesn’t try to force itself into the usual “blockbuster” formula, instead, it exists to open eyes and start conversations. Having a renowned actress like Maris Racal gives the film a real chance to break through and reach the wider audience it deserves.Now let me make a completely different and specific take. We often argue for the legalization of abortion for these reasons: cases of rape or coercion, inaccessibility of contraceptives, the lack of proper sex education, and the health risk that comes with women resorting to unsafe means of abortion. All of these are very very real, but we often oversee a simple fact —that many women are just NOT READY TO BE MOTHERS. Which is why the confrontation between Sunshine and Pastor Jaime struck with me. Simply because sexual desire is natural. Hormones, curiosity, and intimacy are physiologically innate within us. Yet discussions of sexuality are shrouded in taboo. Sex is framed as sacred, premarital sex as sinful, and expression of desire as something to be suppressed. Telling young women “kung ’di pa kasi ready, ’wag nalang makipag-sex” ignores the realities — not only of the youth but women in general — and places a burden of purity and morality solely on girls while the system fails to provide us the education, resources, and safe spaces needed to navigate this issue responsibly and safely. Regardless of reason, no woman should be deprived of rights over her own body. A right that’s still treated like a debate in a country where “godliness” is apparently put above the reproductive autonomy and wellbeing of women.",2025-11-28,0,0,watch,False

reeladvicenet,8,"Source: www.reeladvice.net/2025/12/sunshine-2024-movie-review.htmlAntoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine has been one of our most anticipated local releases of the year and it does not disappoint. Emotionally charged and socially resonant, the film tackles teen pregnancy and the realities of limited reproductive rights in the Philippines with honesty and empathy. While it may not offer clear-cut moral answers, Sunshine succeeds in revealing the real and painful stakes of becoming a young mother tackling equally both sides of the moral coin.National gymnast Sunshine (Maris Racal) has always dreamed of competing in the Olympics. With qualifiers fast approaching, she pushes her body to its limits until she suddenly faints during training. What she assumes is exhaustion from her intense regimen and strict diet turns out to be something far more life-altering: she is pregnant. At only 19 and with her lifelong dream on the line, Sunshine faces a bitter decision: keep the child and lose her final chance at the Olympics, or pursue an illegal abortion and grapple with the moral and emotional fallout.As expected, Sunshine doesn’t shy away from tough conversations. Its central dilemma is painfully relatable, regardless of where you stand on the right to choose in a predominantly Catholic country. Maris Racal is a revelation, delivering a nuanced and deeply human performance as a young athlete forced to confront consequences that will shape the rest of her life. And while we won’t spoil where the story ultimately lands, the film takes a definitive stance without betraying the complexity of its subject matter. It was a balancing act handled with notable care.What elevates Sunshine further is how vividly it captures the societal pressures and chaotic realities of Philippine society when it comes to the right to choose. The judgment, the ironies, the lack of support systems, everything feels painfully authentic and grounded. Where the film stumbles slightly is in its more fantastical elements. Though the intent behind these sequences is clear, they often feel out of place and not fully integrated into the narrative, appearing more convenient than cohesive. Still, Sunshine is a compelling and important watch and not only for Maris Racal’s standout performance but for its bold and compassionate exploration of an issue that remains deeply relevant in modern Philippine society. It’s a film that provokes and ultimately shines.",2025-11-27,0,0,watch,False

Furthermore, a lot of people tend to shame these children for bringing more children into the world without even knowing the full story, leading to these children feeling afraid to open up about what happened to them — thus making them use extreme methods in order to rid of the pregnancy due to the fact that abortion is illegal in the country, as well as to avoid the shame that comes with people knowing about their pregnancy.",2025-11-27,0,0,watch,True

Long vent incoming…This film bro I have never felt something that raw and real and to think that this is what many women even young girls go through and the fact that it’s here in the Philippines is just so hard since everyone here is so deeply rooted in religion and shaming those who want to prioritize themselves and not to be held down by this fucking expectation na “magkaka-anak ka din balang araw” Even at my young age I dreaded the thought that I’d have to bear a kid and raise it someday because my family says so- everyone says so. But then again, why should I tie myself down with that expectation? Why can’t I decide for myself if I do want to have a kid or if I don’t in the future?Even up until now iniisip ko talaga na ayoko magka anak bc IN THIS ECONOMY?? IN THIS FUCKED UP WORLD??And it’s also not even that, I have so many trauma and issues its crazy 😭 I think I’m definitely not in the right state of mind/mental health space to even see myself having kids in the future, and the thought of just repeating the cycle of trauma on my own kid in the future? That’s something I want to spare them from.This movie just HITS that spot. And you know what? Not wanting to have kids or being unsure of it, it’s okay. Because at the end of the day it’s your body, your choice. It’s okay to pursue your dreams and prioritize yourself. I know it might not mean much since hello asa pinas tayo ?? We need more people to be woke/educated and for people to see that not all women can afford to have a kid and some are forced to because of unfortunate circumstances and that scene with doktora in the public hospital and yung tito? KALOKA RAGE BAIT TALAGA but it hurts knowing that actually happens and the other choice you’ll have is dangerous drugs and operations that could very well kill you instead of being able to have a form of healthcare for women that could be much more safer and free from judgement… you’d just want to hope that in these changing times na baka sakali na maintindihan din nila katulad tong pinagdaanan ni Sunshine and many, many more other women, even young girls. And the presence of the kids as mere hallucinations and the personification of their What If’s for the kids, I have those thoughts as well but then again, like they say, I rather regret not having a kid than regret having them.

It's not literal, she's not ill in the head, it's a part of the story the movie wants to show.Most mothers from the previous previous generations have the similar story of giving up their dreams because they got pregnant and started a family at a young age. So Sunshine's story kind of counters that, which is really cool.It's very interesting that it's about a strong topic... abortion by young adults in the Philippines. I mention the country because I've watched other movies about abortion in the U.S., and it's nowhere near as sad as this. (i.e: Unpregnant (2020)).I personally know someone, although not an athlete, but went through this exact thing and upon seeing this, I feel more deeply for her.I hate men who don't use their brains, and do not care enough to wear protection. And I hate that women have to only either keep it against their will, or settle for this dangerous and illegal way to fix their problem. This is why it's really only up to us women to be definitely wise about our bodies. Be smart. Don't rely or entrust yourselves on these good-for-nothing men.Yeah sorry, this movie affected me.

Dumbass doctor- Minors getting pregnant through incest IS VERY COMMON IN THE PH.

kalhivils,8,"The film shows that abortion isn’t always the “bad” thing people make it out to be. For some women, it’s a necessary option especially when they’re not ready emotionally, physically, or financially to raise a child. But as much as possible, it’s important to avoid sexual activity at a very young age or when you’re not prepared, because every decision you make will affect the child. I also believe abortion should be legal, because in many situations, carrying a pregnancy to term can be unsafe. We need to stay open-minded and understand that not everyone has the same circumstances.The movie also highlights how close-minded some people can be, and how our local hospitals especially public ones still struggle with safety, hygiene, and proper care. Healthcare should be accessible and free, especially for those who can’t afford it. Decision natin toh pls choose the right thing. Always. Stay safe.",2025-11-26,0,0,watch,True

cashukey,8,"WOW!!!shet wtf ang ganda!!! teka waittt will edit this para sa review buzy langEDIT: ( so heto na nga mga bading)HI, SUNSHINE!It took me days to figure out how I would write my review for Sunshine. It wasn’t just because I was busy (gosh, I hate having an actual life), but also because I needed time to take this film in. Like I’ve said, IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. I really had to think everything through just to articulate exactly how this film made me feel. And once again, I’m haunted by the regret of not watching another absolute banger in theaters when it was released. I’m so sorry, Direk Tonet!! Sunshine deserves to be seen on the big screen, and I’m forever broken by the fact that I didn’t get to experience it there!!!!But enough of that already, let me finally get on with my actual review.First, I want to say na bilib ako sa tapang ng pelikulang ito, and the same sentiments go to everyone behind Sunshine. To talk about abortion in a country where it’s considered taboo—a very conservative, religious, and deeply judgmental society like ours—is already a risk in itself. Yet this film went there. And that was so, so brave, exactly the kind of bravery people in today’s generation need to see. Same with my co-letterboxd reviewers heree. You guys are awesome for talking about it! It genuinely gladdens me to see that most of the reviews here are filled with positivity and enlightenment. I love that so many viewers agree that what Sunshine did was not only necessary, but the right thing to do. A lot of us now are far more open and accepting, and many finally understand that abortion goes deeper than the knee-jerk ‘masama yan’ mindset many were raised with. You guys rock!Now, the film from beginning to end was—WOW. Grabe! Honestly, it was so beautiful, pero hindi ko pa rin maiwasang kabahan. I still had my fingers crossed because I really thought she might change her mind at the last minute and decide to keep Bata. I was scared that the film would shift from something liberating to something trapped once again in the usual Filipino cultural expectations. But thank goodness I was proven wrong. Also, I’ll admit, I was confused at first kung sino ba si Bata. Akala ko siya si Sunshine as a kid. Mas naging malinaw lang talaga sa akin kung sino siya noong dumating na si Ariana. But, mamaya na natin siya pag-usapan.This film is a powerful example of why legalizing abortion in the Philippines is important. With Sunshine’s story, being just two months away from finally reaching her big dreams—only for everything to be jeopardized by an unwanted pregnancy—is such a heavy and heartbreaking burden. And yes, her reason for not wanting to keep the pregnancy and become a mother is completely valid. I’m genuinely happy that she stood by her decision. Her dream is the Olympics, not becoming a young mother—and choosing herself was the right thing to do. Yes, she made a mistake by engaging in sexual activity at a young age without protection, but this is exactly where proper sex education should come in. If only our education system focused on teaching children about the things that actually matter—their bodies, consent, responsibility, and safe sex—situations like Sunshine’s wouldn’t be treated as moral failures, but as preventable circumstances. If we taught young people the truth instead of scaring them with shame, we wouldn’t have to watch teenagers face life-altering consequences they were never prepared for. Maybe then—if sex education were implemented properly—the chances of needing abortion might be lower (but never zero), and could potentially be prevented if it’s really that strongly considered sinful or unwelcome in this country, ONLY IF we also truly advocate for and implement proper sex education. But again, as a woman, not wanting to legalize abortion for any reason is beyond unacceptable. Legalizing it isn’t an invitation for anyone to engage in sexual activity recklessly, or to encourage others to go do it themselves, or whatever else people think. It isn’t about them—it is about a woman, a person, who needs hope, a chance, and a life that isn’t trapped in a cruel world where she feels neglected.(Shet, ang dami ko pang gustong sabihin! I hope anyone actually reading this can hang in there, I really tend to go on endlessly when I find something this interesting. At nag-explain pa talaga yan sha.)Now, going back to Ariana—’yung dahilan kung bakit siya nabuo is sobrang nakakapanghina. Menggay is only 13 years old. At that age, she should only be worrying about herself, not carrying a child. My heart completely dropped when I heard her age. Her body is only starting puberty, and to make things worse, it was all because of her own uncle. Tangina mo, Bobot! Whether Sunshine will literally hit him in the head with that bottle of Red Horse (?) or not, I’m passing the message telepathically to Sunshine na basagin yung bote sa ulo ng hayop na ‘yon. Kulang pa nga yung inabot niyang iyon sa kahayupan niya. tangina siya, tarantado!LAHAT NG MANYAKIS AT MAPANSAMANTALANG TAO, SANA HINDI KAYO MAMATAY PARA MARANASAN NIYO LAHAT NG HIRAP SA MUNDO, TANGINA JIYO.Now tell me, kung bakit hindi pa rin dapat i-legalize ang abortion sa Pilipinas? Ang story ni Sunshine at Menggay ay iilan lamang sa napakaraming rason kung bakit kailangan ng abortion sa Pilipinas. At ito pa, andito na naman sa pinakaayoko, ang ipapasa-diyos ang nangyari, na parang literal na siya ang bahala sa lahat. At kailangan pa talagang humingi ng sorry sa kaniya? Bakit? Para saan? Kapag tinuloy ba nila, si God ba ang mag-aalaga? Siya ba ang maghihirap for the rest of their lives? Siya ba ang gagastos? Alam niyo na ang sagot. Kaya sobrang bullshit to force Sunshine na magsorry kay papa God dahil sa ginawa niya. Also, just look at what actually happens to women in this country na nagpa‑paabort. Halos ikamatay na nila dahil hindi safe. And honestly, it’s so funny pa to think na sa tabi pa talaga ng simbahan makakahanap ng pampalaglag, diba? At kung ayaw talaga ng Diyos doon, edi sana, ayon sa logic nila, matagal nang nasunog ‘yung mga nagtitinda. Since ayun naman lagi nilang sinasabi, masusunog kapag masama (kaya siguro ang hot q).Now, with Racal’s performance naman. Baks, wala na akong masabi. Ang husay niya! I saw her video post talking about what she did with her script, and she said that after Sunshine found out she was pregnant, she went on autopilot with one goal, to get rid of the baby. And you can clearly see it in her character, present but determined. Galing! Wow k jan!!!Aaaaahhhh, ang dami-dami ko pa talagang gustong sabihin, but I’m pretty sure it would take me a month or so pa to finish. Basta, the bottom line is—Sunshine isn’t just a good movie. It transcends the typical. It breaks boundaries in storytelling, performance, and, most importantly, in social impact. This film makes you think, feel, and confront realities many would rather ignore. Sobrang Pinoy rin ng vibes niya. Have I forgotten to mention how ganda the cinematography is? Legit, walang tapon sa pelikula na ito. Sunshine is not only a breakthrough in Filipino cinema, it’s a bold statement for our society, showing that films can challenge norms, spark conversation, and leave a mark. At sana nga, sa lahat ng nakapanood ng Sunshine, nagets niyo rin ang punto.A round of applause, a standing ovation, and full-blown respect to Director Antonette Jadaone’s Sunshine (SOBRANG OA)—from me and all my countless personalities.",2025-11-26,0,1,watch,True

The film has its own story to tell, independent of the personal character of the actress portraying the lead.I believe the storytelling could have been strengthened by presenting the sports aspect more clearly, rather than relying heavily on context clues.

Kung right and wrong lang ang pag-uusapan, madaling husgahan ang karakter niya. Pero hindi. Maraming aspeto ang nagpapakumplikado ng lahat. Hindi iisa, hindi dadalawa. Hindi lang itim at puti, kundi makulay talaga. Wala ngang tama at mali; ang meron lang e kung anong direksyon ang tatahakin niya kasi either way, mababagabag si Sunshine. Kahit anong maging desisyon niya, talo pa rin siya. Noong eksena ngang naospital siya sa unang attempt niya, I was hoping that she succeeded. It was so heartbreaking kasi to see a young woman go through that painful process without anyone caring for her. With all the thoughts in her head and the pain in her body, it’s mind damning. Mamumulat ka talaga. Maaawa ka. She has a bright future ahead of her pero tao lang din siya. Bata. Walang magulang. Mahirap. Walang kwenta pa naging shota.

I was expecting something moving, empowering and uplifting, like a zero-to-hero movie, defying odds but what I get was pretty dark and bittersweet I suppose. Sunshine is a big surprise that it is very dark, devastating, heartbreaking but also extremely funny and comical. But it is very serious. It is very relevant to the current climate, where women in many countries are not facilitated enough, not enough healthcare for women and young women in general going through the same situation, abortion, and laws that strip away women’s rights and choices. This Philipphine drama really hits close to home as our fellow South-east asia country, that sometimes religion takes precedence over everything. Hiding behind religions and God, condemning others about their decisions, shaming others. Sunshine is very raw and blunt when talking about these issues. Sunshine should be a clear message to many countries how systemic failure causes damage to young women who is going through similar issue. Society fails to provide enough help and accessible healthcare, but also support from society. As we can see, there are only women involved in showing care and compassion throughout them movie.

I went into this with only very vague knowledge on what it's about (although I do know that the abortion part does not come with a long-distance travel), and the turn in the last third is wholly unexpected. It's both comforting and harrowing, it speaks to the problems right-on while presenting that yes, there is a future where we will be able to choose.To be able to choose is to shine the light of sunshine. Sunshine and her sisters faces their burdens at night, where every choice they make will affect their tomorrows. But in reality, women are still unable to live with the freedom to decide for their future. If they can't choose to not carry life, then what about their future life?Why is it men who has to be the authority of life? To carry life is a burden that risks the life of people who has the ability to that. Why can't they choose to not carry the burden? Why should their lives be ruined for not wanting to bear the burden?This should be shown to teenagers, it's a shame that this gets slapped with 16+ everywhere (although the number of ""fuck!"" being spoken might be to blame). It's important while being artistically wonderful. There's a lot to adore in this film, from the acting to the humor to the colours, it's chock full of life.

rof999ia,8,"Ang daming kalaban ni Sunshine. ‘Yung sarili niya, si Miggy ang bumuntis sa kanya, Thea ang best friend niya, si Doktora, Coach, Kultura, moral, paniniwala, at higit sa lahat–ang sarili niya, the little Sunshine in her. That fight she took on was for the little girl who dreamt bigger than Manila could ever be. A dream so big and gripped so close to the heart, that it brought her to the stage she shone the brightest in. In the Filipino culture, where an already embedded Catholic belief system among Filipinos insists itself as a dominant value. Religion is the law–both moral and written. The system, therefore, finds itself an enemy to Sunshine. When your whole body rejects a value you’ve held onto as a child, you will take the pain of leaving your morals behind and choosing the path that feels right. ‘Yung labag sa loob mo, pero, kailangan mo–kailangan mong piliin ang sarili mo. In the laws of Religion, masamang bagay ang ginawa ni Sunshine. Disgraced by the OB-GYNE doctor from her abortion attempt, invaded by the Pastor and child to make negotiations for reputation's sake, and the stigma her fellow students held onto her for being pregnant. Hindi ito sakit. However, what stood out to me was hypocrisy. The Ate from which Sunshine brought her pills from in Quiapo reaps the benefits of both Catholic figures and abortion pills. The opposing beliefs and the lack of a moral standpoint are, in themselves, a belief. The birth of different belief systems creates a divide in the basis of faith. As for the Ate, she manages to capitalize on the ideas of both, prioritizing the capitalistic wealth over the spiritual one.",2025-09-08,0,0,watch,False

anjelaera,8,"Raw, urgent, devastating. Antoinette Jadaone’s Sunshine follows a teen gymnast whose unplanned pregnancy threatens not just her dream, but her sense of safety. The film makes it clear: laws and conservative norms that say they protect often do the opposite, forcing women into danger and silence.Yet, Sunshine also shows the deep solidarity between women—holding each other up when everything else fails. Their strength is real, but it shouldn’t be an excuse for a broken system. Valorizing resilience without demanding accountability lets those in power off the hook.Quiapo wasn’t just a scenery. It’s a lived map of the problem. Crowded streets, devotional stalls, and informal markets where abortifacients appear next to religious items, showing how faith, commerce, and survival collide to leave women with few safe options. More than anything, Sunshine challenges us to face the stories we’d rather not see. Those stories that are real, painful, and demand difficult conversations.📍ABC Hall, Osaka, Japan • OAFF 2025 Expo",2025-09-03,0,0,watch,True

natsuyuki,8,"✨ON THE PSYCHE OF A TEENAGE GIRL IN A PARADOXICAL CITY✨I usually step into the cinema with my ears wide open for melodic or even textural cues, so at first, I was disappointed that Sunshine was not narrated by music.Yet, this film is a mirror to reality. What drives it is the noise of the outskirts of Manila. It perfectly captures the city’s paradoxes—how medicines for abortion are sold right outside the church, how even those we look up to in the pulpit sometimes abolish the very values they preach. And we see all of this through the lens of a teenager with big dreams, someone who has always been drowned out by the voices outside her own.I love how her sport, gymnastics, becomes a metaphor for letting go of the noise to hear that determined, resounding music inside her. Even the ribbon she uses in her routines subtly foreshadows the choice she will make by the end of the film.Kudos to Direk Antoinette Jadaone for being brave enough to tackle a taboo topic in a self-proclaimed Christian nation.And while the score isn’t the narrative driving force, the intentionality of using it sparingly only makes those few moments shine even brighter.",2025-08-25,0,0,watch,False

Hands down to Sunshine, it perfectly depicted the many realities of filipino girls and womens who has and still continue to suffer by a long-broken and failing system of healthcare in our country.This film is a great opportunity to spread awareness, not just for everybody but for the higher-ups who have more authority in providing the necessary changes required to solve this issue. It's about time for all of us to listen with our hearts and open our minds to this kind topics that are very relevant to our society today. Another takeaway from Sunshine: Parenthood is not for everybody simply because not everyone is fit to be one (which is okay) and the sooner we accept that the better tbh.At sa huli, iba talaga ang sariling atin kasi grabe yung kalidad na kayang ibigay at ipakita ng pelikulang pilipino sa buong mundo.

ivorystl,8,"bata pa para magmura pero ‘di bata para pilitin na magdala ng buhay sa sinapupunan? maris racal embodied the cry for help that is screaming in every woman in this country. this is a movie that is made for all filipina, by a filipina, and through a filipina — sunshine. she is every good and bad and all in between this country is. mapapaisip ka na lang talaga na bawat mura valid. hindi natin sinusuportahan ang teenage pregnancy, pero ‘di rin ‘to dahilan para isara ang usapan patungkol sa abortion. dahil hindi sa lahat ng pagkakataon ang pagbubuntis ay bunga ng pagmamahalan, kung kadalasan ay may mga gaya ni menggay — bunga ito ng pangaabuso. regardless, a woman should have the right to decide. paano kung nandiyan na? nagbunga na? the only question we all should be asking is: what are the safe choices available to women when she decided to not continue? with all my heart, i am not ashamed to say that abortion should be one of the options, because it is healthcare.sa gitna ng init at madilim na maynila, ipinakita ni sunshine na hindi siya magpapatalo, kahit pa magdala ito ng panganib sa kaniya. she faced her adversities with grace despite her shaking nerves. and in that moment, i felt like i was there with sunshine, making a space for myself in that tiny filthy room. and i wish i was. i wish i was there to hold sunshine. that sequence alone shows that this country puts women in dangerous position — alone and afraid. when they’re supposed to be supported and cared for in such difficult times, not ridiculed and preyed upon. because a choice should not be dressed as shame, it should be shrouded with pride and dignity. amidst all the pain that is sipping from the story, sunshine saw that even in the roughest edge of life, kindness and sense of community in every filipino will always remain. it’s just that, in reality, the truth is not all women are meant to be mothers. especially not a child. despite the crazy scene between that ob-gyne doctor and sunshine in the maternity ward, i heard her loud and clear: “gising na ang bata”, nagising na siya sa reyalidad.",2025-08-17,3,0,watch,False

ramdelossantos,8,"From Jane in Fan Girl, Mace in That Thing Called Tadhana, Joanne in Never Not Love You, and especially Lillia Cuntapay in Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay, Antoinette Jadaone has never been afraid to push boundaries and champion strong women leads. However with Sunshine, she takes on one of the most urgent and most avoided issues in the Philippines, women’s reproductive rights. It’s a subject that still feels taboo in mainstream conversation, weighed down by religion, politics, and stigma, yet Jadaone dives right in, making a film that’s both brave and necessary.Maris Racal leads the film and delivers what I think is her best performance yet. She carries Sunshine with a mix of quiet strength and raw vulnerability. Every hesitation, every glance, every burst of courage feels lived-in. Alongside her, Jennica Garcia is a standout as Sunshine’s feisty sister, funny, protective, and fiercely loyal.That said, Sunshine isn’t flawless. One recurring element (the little girl who keeps appearing as a symbol) doesn’t always land. It does add emotional weight, but there are moments in the film where it felt like it's trying hard to be poetic which the story didn't need as it's strong enough on its own.However, there is no denying of the film's influence. Sunshine, challenges the taboo around women's choices and their bodies in the country. It shows the limits that society has built against them. It challenges the audience with the harsh reality of women in the Philippines, to empathize, and perhaps even to reconsider beliefs that were thrust upon us.The performances by Racal, Garcia, and the film's women ensemble were bold, the message timely, and incredibly personal.

Showcasing the different types of women and the choices they make with the hardships they face. The actors did a stellar job delivering their roles with such depth but in a calm yet strong performances from the lead (Maris Racal) to supporting casts.Sunshine is a wake up call that choosing yourself before anything is not selfish.

skilty,8,"Sunshine glows with a quiet brilliance, weaving through the shadows of its heavy subject matter with the grace of a film that knows precisely when to hold back and when to break you open. The narrative feels unforced yet deeply felt, as though the film is simply breathing alongside its audience, letting the undercurrents of sacrifice, determination, and bittersweet resolve infuse every frame. It’s cinema that neither wallows in its pain nor shies away from it.At the heart of this achievement is Maris Racal, delivering what can only be described as a star-making performance. Racal inhabits her role with a disarming naturalness, navigating the character Sunshine's emotional terrain with nuance and restraint that make every flicker of joy, every crack in her voice, and every moment of silence resonate all the more. She doesn’t perform so much as she exists on screen, making the character’s struggles and small triumphs feel achingly personal. Her chemistry with the ensemble cast only amplifies the film’s emotional pull, but it’s in her solo moments that you realize you’re watching an actor step into her full power.If there’s a stumble, it’s in a sequence that leans heavily into magical realism and heightened sentiment: well-intentioned but a touch uneven compared to the rest of the film’s assured storytelling. Still, Sunshine’s value lies beyond its craft; it opens space for difficult but necessary conversations about the tangled intersections of agency and structure in abortion, religion, and healthcare in the Philippines. It’s a tender, unflinching work, and Racal is its radiant core.",2025-08-14,4,0,watch,False

fralactus,8,"I'm glad this movie's gaining the traction that it's getting. It makes for a tough conversation, but it's a dialogue that needs to be had. I watched it during its 3rd week here in the Philippines, but the fact that it's about to go on its 5th week is a huge deal! Things are looking bright.With Sunshine herself, I've never seen any of Maris Racal's movies/shows, but she definitely carried this movie. She showed so much vulnerability and grit, and I'm glad this movie didn't hold back with its punches showing the journey she went through. She was definitely in good hands being directed by Antoinette Jadaone.Having seen a good amount of Jadaone's movies, she really does well with writing female characters. She doesn't make a princess out of them in her stories, instead she creates such raw figures that are passionate but flawed. They're put out of their comfort zone, placing them in situations that give them a reality check that changes them. Sunshine, to me, is probably Jadaone's best, pushing those boundaries.Personally, there's a lot of love to give this movie, but the few things I'd complain about with Sunshine are really just nitpicks. First off is the use of code switching. Jadaone's movies aren't great with that, honestly. In this movie, it didn't sound natural and came off more theatrical, taking away from the grounded tone. It didn't make or break the story, but it did pull me out a bit. The other thing would be the use of a celebrity cameo. It happens during such a pivotal scene and I'm not sure if the cameo really had to be in that moment because it felt distracting. Either way, Maris Racal's performance was so strong, she brought the attention back to her.Regarding other things I loved about Sunshine, the kids impacted the movie hard! The way they were used to show conflict towards Sunshine's act of abortion displayed how sensitive of an act it really is. They bring up the conversation of choosing your own life or theirs, the failure of the healthcare system, and the type of pigs people can be. The conversation that struck me a lot was honestly the one regarding religion and how it viewed abortion. Being someone who's grown up with family members who have similar views, the dialogue sounded like an echo. Having seen Sunshine, I'd honestly show it to them in hopes for an understanding that there's more to life than scripture.Sunshine is another one of those movies that prove how good PH Cinema is at displaying the faults of the Philippine society. It has a stance and seeks justice. Hopefully someday, the freedom of choice is given and brings us to a brighter future.",2025-08-13,0,0,watch,False

Being in this body is a horror on its own and seeing those horrors unfold on screen made me emotional.

magiicarps,8,"I approached this film with a fair amount of skepticism, scared how this film might be twisted into something anti-abortion/pro-life, and there were points in the film that made me question Antoinette Jadaone's true stance on abortion. This film is far from perfect, but it should not bar it from receiving any merit, especially from the local and international scene.Many people wax poetic about Maris Racal (Sunshine)'s and Jennica Garcia (Ate Geleen)'s performances, and I wholeheartedly agree. But, my favorite scene does not even center around the actresses. Maris Racal had very few lines when she walked in the maternity ward: it was framed in such a way that the spotlight was given to the mothers. In that cramped, underequipped ward, how many of them chose to be mothers? How many of them did not have any choice? What kind of socioeconomic condition are they bringing their children into? Is that in any way just or fair for both mother and child? This film is more than just about whether or not you are pro/anti-abortion, but what it means to bring life into this country. I hope people see the material conditions in which mothers are forced to raise their children, and how these conditions work against so many women who are just like Sunshine, Ate Geleen, and Mary Grace.Truly, this is one of Direk Tonet's best work yet. I can only hope Maris Racal continues to accept more gripping films like Sunshine.",2025-08-12,0,0,watch,False

inthisfall,8,"Sunshine follows a young woman named Sunshine, an aspiring gymnast on the cusp of joining the national team. However, on her way to the tryouts, she discovers she is pregnant. From that premise alone, you can already sense the film’s intended message. The real question is—did it manage to convey that message effectively, and was it worth watching?Honestly, there were moments when I wished the storytelling had leaned toward subtler messaging. At times, the delivery felt jarring, with certain lines of dialogue seeming out of place against the film’s overall themes. The whole subplot involving the little girl, while clearly meant to be uncanny, didn’t quite land for me. I’m not sure if it was the dialogue, the acting, or both, but the scenes didn’t hit the emotional beats they were aiming for.The storyline with the pregnant child, which could have been deeply moving, failed to evoke much emotion for me. The relationship between Sunshine and the child felt rushed and underdeveloped—lacking the depth and “meat” that could have made it more impactful. And while the film did attempt to portray the pressure Sunshine was under, it felt limited. Aside from her coach and the broader societal judgment, there didn’t seem to be other tangible forces at play. Given her status as a decorated gymnast, surely there would have been more parties invested in her career and personal choices.That said, the film absolutely succeeded in its core objective: to shed light on the struggles young pregnant women face—the emotional turmoil they endure (a burden I would argue no man could fully comprehend) and the necessity of abortion as an option. In a society steeped in religiosity, Sunshine sparked discussions, provoked current beliefs, and opened minds. Was it worth watching? Absolutely—100 percent. Films should provoke thought, and this one certainly did.In terms of performances, I have no complaints about the cast (apart from the awkwardness with the child actors) and some peculiar dialogue choices. Maris Racal, in particular, was phenomenal—truly the anchor of the film. Her range and emotional depth were on full display, and she’s the reason I remained engaged throughout. Honestly, if anyone else had played Sunshine, the impact would have been far less potent. I even found myself shedding a tear by the end, purely because of her performance.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Sunshine in theaters—especially with the guy on the back's funny commentaryoverall 4/5",2025-08-10,0,0,watch,False

denlebantino,8,"On SUNSHINE by Antoinette Jadaone: A film can only get better not with its insistence on a belief but its provocation. When it does provoke, it lays down what triggers a conversation rather than merely playing woke. It tells us to look into the very fabric of our being: challenged, wounded, longing to have the freedom to choose. Not long in the film Sunshine (Maris Racal) gets on and off a classic puj with a huge phrase on its top front: Gift of God. The film uses a tool for contention against its voice, telling us it is aware of the moral indignation it faces.The film lays down everything in clear context: Agitated, confused, and lost Sunshine on the streets of Manila; by and in its proverbial structures (school, church, motel) with her dreams at stake.Jadaone captures Manila as the rightful milieu where Sunshine struggles to walk through cramped, narrow spaces in pursuit of her dreams which are challenged by society's expectations.This is cinema opening up a conversation that does not displace religion. It actually depicts vulnerable humanity, and the conditions that make it hard for people, especially women, to exercise their own agency.The film is especially brilliant in how it captures Sunshine navigating her choice and along the way showing empathy for others. The part where she connects with a young girl expands the film's statement on how women and children are left to suffer without much of a choice. I'm not crazy about the penultimate scene, though.Visualizing Sunshine's internal struggles through that little girl played by Annika Co is a good choice, albeit too much in the end. The statement in the penultimate scene need not be said as the two characters' gestures already speak it.The film should've thrown out such literalism and just allowed us to make sense of it without the words. We could've silently uttered them ourselves.",2025-08-08,0,0,watch,False

It talks about abortion in in a more deeper sense, but not that morally god-fearing shit that they usually shove to our months, but rather, it focuses on women, their dreams, and the healthcare that they need. I just wish that the Philippines will consider legalizing abortion and the proper healthcare that women should receive. It’s always been “how about the child?” bro, the kid wasn’t even born yet, but we tend to forget—the mother, who will literally carry the child, and motherhood? that’s not fucking easy. I love the little kids aspect symbolizing their conscience, guilt, and innocence, but I think they are more directly portrayed as the personification of the unborn child. and the scenes of Manila? this is one of the films that really captured the heart of the unfiltered Manila streets. The noise, the pollution, the authenticity, and the familiarity. “Gets ko na, gets na kita”That line in the ending made me smile.

And when I found out that it was a local film about teenage pregnancy, I got vertigo from rolling my eyes because I expected a Ted Talk on abortions disguised as filipino acting (aka “ hysterics and histrionics).In fact I prematurely dismissed this as a hokey afterschool special and joked that they should have just called this ‘Maris Racal: Ate Nadali ‘ Well. Sunshine is the best example that nothing is as delicious as sinking your teeth into a wet, juicy wrongburger with a slice of humble pie for dessert. Let’s start with the performances. The acting was so authentic and so genuine at times it felt like I should apologize for sticking my nose into their conversations. I think the caster should also be given their flowers because I don’t think anyone other than the artists could have played them in the film. I expected Maris Racal to Rachel Berry her role as Sunshine but she played it with such earnest aplomb, she made her struggle so real and visceral, I still didn’t know how to handle it even if I was just a fly on the wall. Then there’s the (I’m doing the air quotes with my fingers) TWIST that Stevie Wonder could see a mile a way… but that really wasn’t the rug pull here. Actually it was pretty smart and meta that the rug pull was the fact that the reveal wasn’t a rug pull. At the end of the film, it wasn’t resolved if abortion is bad or good, or if the Church is unsympathetic or cares genuinely, or if teenage pregnancy is the choice of the mother or the family.

It tackles the struggles most women suffer in a country that suffocates them.It's baffling that to this day, the Philippines still does not legalize abortion, divorce, and same-sex marriage. All of these stem from religionism that was pushed down our throats by one of our colonizers—the Spaniards. And it's funny how all of these are legal in their country now, and we're still stuck and continuously regressing—all because of a belief and an intangible figure.And Sunshine was able to highlight that. The pressure from society and the backward thinking of its people—especially that certain doctor in the film—are among the reasons why basic rights and safer options are still being denied to women, why abortion is still being frowned upon.I hope more upcoming films will dare to challenge the status quo, without the concern of playing it ""safe,"" something that I think persisted somehow in Sunshine.

ethan_mateo,8,"Antoinette Jadaone, one of the most interesting and exciting filmmaker working today is a champion of realism, and-or, telling the story as it is. This style compliments humor (Six Degrees of Separation from Lilia Cuntapay), romance (That Thing Called Tadhana), or drama (Fan Girl). Her latest effort aims to tackle a taboo topic amongst Filipinos, and based on her latest works it's pretty evident that she's the right person for the job.Sunshine is a neatly paced movie with a force of an acting from Maris Racal as the titular character. Jadaone managed to brought the audience into the streets of Metro Manila, effectively making the whole city claustrophobic by the help of sound mixing. However, I find myself not being a fan of some of the writing decision. First, it took me a long time to fully digest the Kid as a narrative device; I would've preferred a raw and natural point of view from our main character. This is more of a preferential complain and I wouldn't fault the movie for it, since I also understood what it's going for. My second issue is a subplot being suddenly introduced in the second act. It's easy to understand why they had to mix in some sort of parallel to make the subtext richer, but it disrupted the movie's cohesiveness and flow.Nevertheless, this movie exists for a reason, it already existed as the lives of many and will continue to be.",2025-08-03,20,0,watch,True

However, if the movie talks about social and political issues like it has in SUNSHINE, I can tune and lock in.SUNSHINE is straightforward to its message. It's about dealing with abortion in a country where not only is illegal but also discriminated hardly. A sensitive topic portrayed with a really good script by Jadaone. What a complete package in terms of writing. The story is justified.Even though I may have found the climactic moments not explosive enough, I'm sure the average Filipino conservative does. Personally, I am pro-abortion and I believe women have the rights to their own bodies. I'm glad the movie went in the direction I wanted. As someone who has seen a lot of abortion films in Holywood, this is the first Filipino. And I just applaud everyone in this project for the risk and making a statement through SUNSHINE. For that, it's already a big win for independent Filipino cinema as theaters flock and raise the demand.

First off, it's refreshing to see a Filipino actor commit to a role so fully whether its the physicality required as a rhythmic gymnast or the emotional demands of a complex character going through a tumultuous personal conflict, something Maris Racal did admirably. The movie happens basically over three days but delivers a roller coaster ride of emotions for Maris who is in virtually 95% of the scenes and carries all of the heavy lifting. SUNSHINE is also unlike anything Antoinette has ever written and directed and it is wonderful to watch her evolution as a writer and director, tackling such a sensitive and challenging material with sure handed confidence. Meryll Soriano, Elijah Canlas, Xyriel Manabat, Jennica Garcia, Angeli Bayani and others provide ample support but this truly rested on Maris Racal. This movie doesn't have commercial written all over it so when it succeeds like OPPENHEIMER or HOW TO MAKE MILLIONS BEFORE GRANDMA DIES, the performance is something to cheer about. The theater was packed [sold out], had an enthusiastic audience [a little too chatty with some commenting on everything going on] and the film was well-applauded as the credits rolled. Unlike many Filipino films that screen in cinemas but could just as easily be viewed in streaming, SUNSHINE delivers with full power on the big screen. I came in with little background except for the film's premise but was thoroughly immersed for the next 90 minutes. Aside from the writing and direction, the film boasts solid DP work from Pao Orendain and score by Rico Blanco.. Congrats Tonette, Dan, Bianca and the rest of the team behind SUNSHINE.",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,False

siramaris,8,"Honestly, 3.5 stars for the movie overall, but here's extra 0.5 star for the super random cameo that was also somehow super on the nose. It's such a good bit that amuses me to no end. I'd rate the movie higher if not for a plot device that felt completely unnecessary and at times distracting. Take it away, and it won't even change anything about the movie. Every time they employed this plot device, it was just so unnecessary and distracting. The movie also squeezed in too many ""unwanted pregnancy"" tropes that it risked being too bloated story-wise. Think of an ""unwanted pregancy"" trope, it's there. They stop short of it being too bloated at the expense of the story (and you have to give it to Antoinette Jadaone for this balancing act), though I still spent a good chunk of the movie wondering how many more tropes were coming. Still the movie is brave, and is made so much better for its bravery. It does not shy away from the realities faced by so many women in this country when it comes to maternal health. It tackled head-on the heavily religious overtones that tends to dominate the conversations around this topic. It shows the ironic juxtaposition of abortion pills being sold next to religious artifacts. But most importantly, it does not get preachy. It does not feel like it is patronizing the audience about what should be in each scene that squeezes your heart, it just shows it. But also Jennica Garcia steals the show in every scene is in. Maris Racal deserves the accolades she's getting for carrying the movie so steadily as its lead and with everything asked of her for the character. But Jennica Garcia just commands every scene even she doesn't say a word. And every scene these two have together was really gold-medal worthy.",2025-08-02,0,0,watch,False

kacecabali,8,"Sunshine is an important film—one that Filipinos shouldn’t miss. It’s not the strongest film, but it’s certainly worth discussing.In fact, it currently tops my list of Filipino movies this year. And that’s precisely why I feel a sense of disappointment. At the very least, I wish it had resonated more deeply. It had the potential to delve further into its realism, but instead, it chose to spoon-feed every emotional beat, leaving little room for quiet reflection. While I understand why Jadaone took this direction, I can’t say it worked for me.Personally, I wasn’t fully sold on the use of children as a narrative device. The way the film delivers its message too overtly makes the subplot involving the 13-year-old feel disconnected and distracting. The child character might have been more effective as a symbolic presence, her inner voice, her conscience. Had it stayed that way, rather than taking the more problematic route of literally giving life to unborn children, as in Ariana’s case, the film might have delivered a far more powerful impact.Still, there was a moment near the end, a line that marked a turning point of understanding and acceptance, where freedom was finally felt from guilt.

It felt like the film held back, especially in its screenplay and pacing. But as I reflected more on it, I realized that might have been the point—although many of the scenes were commendably filmed, the film wasn’t trying to entertain; it was trying to confront. Maliban sa mismong tema ng storya, sobrang daming iba pang paghihirap na danas ng lipunan natin na mismo ako ay hindi aware ang naipakita sa pelikula.The rawness and silence I initially perceived as weaknesses were actually reflections of Sunshine herself—caught between the pressures of gymnastics and the weight of her misfortunes. In that light, I came to see that her quietness was powerful and already served as the message.The film was created not just to tell Sunshine’s story, but to help us recognize the many ""Sunshines"" around us—especially in the Philippines, where abortion remains heavily stigmatized due to political control and religious conservatism.

Both of those renovations were done in part to address a persistent issue: that the place never runs out of patients. Every day, and especially on Mondays and Fridays, the admitting section would take in a significant number of expectant mothers with all sorts of conditions. Some would be giving birth for the first time. Some were veterans who were familiar to the staff working there, giving birth like clockwork every year. Some had serious conditions alongside their pregnancies that made giving birth extremely complicated, to the point where their current state posed a significant risk for death while giving birth. Nevertheless, they would slowly fill up the adjacent labor and delivery room, often two to three mothers to a stretcher. On very busy days the stretchers would run out, and the labor room would be filled with mothers settling down wherever they could, mostly on the cold, tiled floor.I remembered those days in the admitting section when I saw Antoinette Jadaone's latest film, Sunshine, about a young gymnast (Maris Racal) who gets pregnant right before a very important event that might lead to the SEA games and eventually the Olympics. Sunshine doesn't have any qualms about making the decision as she immediately gets to work trying to find an abortifacient to terminate the unwanted pregnancy. This process is not made easy. Miggy (Elijah Canlas), the man who impregnated Sunshine, wants nothing to do with her after learning of her pregnancy. He doesn't even tell her to have an abortion directly, only saying that 'she knows what to do.' Getting medical help is equally difficult, and intersects gender with class: medical treatment is expensive (despite the fact that state sponsored healthcare should be financially accessible) and as abortion is still illegal in the Philippines, people resort to black markets to seek the care they need.Once in a while, the OB admitting section will receive a patient who has lost her child. Miscarriages are common, and often they are spontaneous. Once, a mother of a stillborn child asked me if the cries in the next room were her child's, when I knew the infant was lying in a box, ready to be given to back to their parents. Then there are the other kinds of patients, ones who made a choice like Sunshine. They all had their reasons; this was a conscious and informed decision. After a while you know it when they come in. Sometimes the doctor would come in and tell them that what they did was illegal, some would even threaten to call the police. Nothing ever came of it; they were empty threats - often to 'scare' them into not making that decision again. It always made me uncomfortable.To be born a woman is to be born into violence, into a world where the odds are stacked against you. Sunshine is not the first film to depict this violence - films like Rae Red's Babae at Baril (2019) and Jadaone's own Fan Girl (2020) are two examples. They show what a deeply patriarchal society creates: people like Miggy and a certain other character near the end, people who I interpreted as not exactly archetypal or allegorical towards the structures that created them, but as the inevitable products of it. But unlike those two films that I mentioned earlier, Sunshine feels far more indignant, full of anger that Fan Girl lacked, and drawing towards a different conclusion compared to Babae at Baril.Quiapo has been a backdrop for many a Filipino film, and here it is a sanctuary of sorts. It is here where Sunshine goes to find the solution to her problems. Ironically draped in religious imagery, it both embodies the faith it represents (as a source of refuge for those who are in need) and as something that stands against its tenets.Sunshine is a film about choices: the choice to live one's own dream, the choice to live freely as the best person you can be. Sunshine's sister Geleen (Jennica Garcia) coaches Sunshine as she practices in their shared home. Certain background elements (thanks to the film's excellent production design) hint that Geleen, too, was once an aspiring gymnast, whose dreams ended with a baby. If she had the choice, would she have lived a different life? It shows as well in Geleen's character, and Garcia gives a standout performance as her.Finally, that idea of ""refuge"" may not refer to Quiapo, but something else entirely. Throughout the film there are many people, both seen and unseen, who help Sunshine in her quest. ""Ipagdadasal ko kayo,"" a hilot tells Sunshine after they bring a child to the hospital who made the same choice. ""Mag-ingat ka,"" another one tells Sunshine as she sets off. A sympathetic medical professional gives a knowing look. Every doctor has a story like it: in one of my last rotations at the labor room, a patient walked in nervously in the robe the hospital supplied her. It was a very busy day, and pregnant women overflowed on the stretchers and sat on the floor. She had no business being here: she looked no older than 14, and she should be going to school and playing with friends, not in the last stages of giving birth. Suffice it to say, this pregnancy was not her choice. If she had the choice like Sunshine did, would she be here? On the other hand, the point of the film for me is not whether one makes one choice over the other, but that people like Sunshine and that kid has the ability to choose in the first place.Because the labor and delivery room should be semi-sterile, companions (in this case, the kid's very worried mother) are not allowed in. But the rest of the mothers in that labor room heard us taking the medical history and heard her story. The other expectant mothers gave the kid their blankets, talked to and comforted her, up until she gave birth. Everyone was that kid's mother that day. In a world where you are denied agency, where one is subjected to violence from birth, the least women can do is find refuge in each other.",2025-07-31,42,2,watch,False

aerollism_,8,"Promise, 'di siya overhype.We’re halfway through 2025 and far from its denouement but I must say that SUNSHINE, if not the best, is one of the best and one of the most important films of the year. I’m so sorry, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION FROM LILIA CUNTAPAY, but I believe I now have my new favorite Antoinette Jadaone’s work. They said during the promotion that this is the last day this will be shown here sa provinces and then starting tomorrow, sadly, it will only be shown to 3 cinemas na lang so I felt the substantial need to watch it tonight. Mind you, sobrang bigat pa rin ng pakiramdam ko, tapos na lahat, at ngayon na tina-type ko lahat ng to.Sunshine heavily tackled significantly sensitive issues here in the country - rape, teenage pregnancy, poor healthcare, and machismo. At habang ina-absorb ko lahat kanina inside the movie theatre, I couldn’t help but think about my two sisters who are the same age as the protagonist. Ang bigat. Ang lala. Ang hapdi. Give me a span of time to write an essay about this and I will take that challenge without a doubt. That’s how it affected me big time. It hits home.Now let’s talk about the performances. First sequence pa lang, it’s apparent that Maris Racal studied the role. Inakap niya at binigyan niya ng kaluluwa yung karakter. Hindi siya bumitaw hanggang final sequence. She had a lot of silent moments in the film and those were the most powerful. Nakakabingi yung katahimikan na halos hinahabol ko na rin yung hininga ko minsan. Jennica Garcia’s character, on the other hand, though it’s just a supporting role, is one of the main highlights throughout. Yung kahit minimal lang yung dialogues niya, tignan mo lang siya sa mga mata niya, maiintindihan mo sya. I love her here. She’s too authentic. May eksena silang dalawa ni Maris dito and that was when I lost it. Iyak ako eh. GRABE YUN. Grabe yun!!!!As for the direction, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, direk Tonet. Iba pa rin talaga kapag ang kwento ng babae ay gawa rin ng babae. Maselan, matapang, at may puso. Salamat sa buhay mo. Nag-uumapaw sa social realism ang pelikula mo. Lino Brocka would’ve been so proud!! Sunshine knows Manila and all its aches and decays. May problema ka? Okay, pero hindi titigil ang mundo. Hindi titigil ang buhay ng mga naka-paligid sa‘yo. Dagdag mo pa na nasa Maynila ka kung saan life is always on survival mode. The film captured those perfectly.Lastly, Sunshine doesn't preach or impose. She makes her decisions but doesn't force you to change your opinion either. Your role as an audience member is to listen. The rest is for you to reflect upon on your own.Gets ko na.",2025-07-31,0,0,watch,True

The amount of meaning etched into every single frame was so tastefully done and was especially satisfying to watch as a young filipina- they could never make me hate you maris racal omg what a star 😭😭😭 sobrang halimaw umarte taena!- i felt like that gif of leonardo dicaprio pointing at the screen whenever i recognized a filming loc LMAOAOOA like omg thats morayta?- i really loved the subliminal messages scattered throughout the film.. all the little moments when you see mothers who clearly did not want to be mothers, the moments when you see children who were born into families unplanned, the moments when the male characters refused to provide assistance when needed.. they made up such little parts of the plot but they added so much volume to the message- i also really liked the choice of making the aborted children their own characters in the story. it may be a double-edged sword kind of thing but i think addressing the ""buhay pa rin yan!"" argument by giving the kids their own autonomy and still concluding that despite fear, they truly just want the best for their mothers was just spot onnn- lowk felt too short LOL like feel ko there was potential for more.. pero the film is enjoyable as it is- somebody else said this already but this was one of those social commentary films that critique today's society simply by showing a woman living a regular week in her life. Like this is the reality of thousands of filipino women. The reason this hit so hard for me and for my sister and all the young filipino women in the cinema with us was because sunshine could easily be usi'm really glad this received critical acclaim because its narratives like these that filipinos need to hear. surviving in the conservative catholic philippines as a woman is nawt for the weak 😭 and its about time that progressive, proudly pro-choice films like sunshine make it big",2025-07-31,1,0,watch,True

glanche,8,"sunshine is a film by Tonet Jadaone. context is very important because if you have seen jadaone’s films (That Thing Called Tadhana, Fangirl, Alone Together among others) then you will know this is HER film. you feel it in every frame. the writing. the direction & performances. there’s no voyeurism here. no moralizing. just truth. honest, specific, sometimes messy truth about what it’s like to be a woman in this country. not in the headlines, not in theory, but in the streets, in health centers, in quiet conversations with friends who are too afraid to say what they really need.maris racal delivers the performance of her life. she holds back when she needs to. she breaks in silence. she carries every scene with restraint, sensitivity & precision. she becomes sunshine. and it’s the kind of performance that demands to be remembered.the ensemble is just as grounded. jennica garcia, thea, the kid: each one brings something real to the table. nothing is forced. they don’t play characters. they play people you’ve probably met. maybe they remind you of someone you know. maybe they remind you of you.what makes sunshine work is not the acting or the direction but the refusal to look away. the film doesnt hide behind a metaphor. it gives us a manila that feels exactly like the one we move through. where pamparegla is sold outside churches. where motels won’t let you in if you’re alone. where grieving teenagers are all around but they have kept it in because no one has dared say “you’re safe here.” from my POV, the film takes a narrative risk. there’s a device that briefly pulls you out of the realism it builds so well. but it sticks the landing. because what matters is that you never stop feeling for these women. and that you leave the theater asking why stories like theirs still feel unsafe to tell.i’ve had my own sunshines, close friends, a relative, a classmate. women who needed care, not judgment. watching this film felt like watching them again. and all i could think was, “please, let her be safe.”this film deserves a seat in our national conversations. not just in cinema panels, but in health committees, in policy rooms, in the offices of people who still think there is a valid excuse to deny access to care.one of the most necessary films of the year.",2025-07-31,1,0,watch,False

ironthroneking_,8,"In an infamous spot near Quiapo church, ""Sunshine"" presents one of the biggest ironies in this Catholic-dominated country. In there, a vendor can be found selling religious figurines and paraphernalia, along with illegal pills and abortifacients tucked in plain sight. What’s more sarcastic is that a poster of ‘Abortion is Murder’ can be sighted on one of the stalls. If you’ve ever been to that place, you know that it’s all true.And so, teen gymnast/aspiring Olympian Sunshine (Maris Racal) searches through the alleyways of the aforementioned Quiapo for a quick solution to her dilemma. How can she terminate her unexpected pregnancy to avoid being disqualified from an upcoming SEA games competition? Director-writer Antoinette Jadaone has always been superb in writing female leads by adding deep empathy to their plight (as seen in “Fan Girl,” “Never Not Love You”). When you have a fully-fleshed character on screenplay, plus an actress who possesses the right amount of emotional depth and range, the resulting portrayal feels genuine and lived in.One of the film’s highlights takes place inside a seedy motel. With only minimal lines, Racal, in a career-defining performance, deftly showcases Sunshine’s internal turmoil and physical pain. Pao Orendain’s sensitive camerawork captures the whole ordeal in an unobtrusive shot. Likewise, his cinematography excellently mirrors the growing anxiety in Sunshine’s head, from the bustling streets of Manila to the crowded wards of public hospitals.Piling up to the metaphorical noise are secondary characters and conservative ideals that dictate what’s best for Sunshine. Admittedly, there are moments where the film could have represented the ‘pro-life’ side more nuanced than an ultra-conservative OB-GYN or a patronizing pastor, as depicted. But the film finds profound intent in the emotional journey that Sunshine goes through, with no sympathy begging that most advocacy films do.Hence, it will be reductive to say that “Sunshine” is just a pro-abortion film. Instead, it is a complex look on womanhood and pregnancy, and how the Philippines’ patriarchal laws fail to prioritize their bodies. It is also an admission of how Catholic guilt shames young women engaging in premarital sex, when young men should also be equally put into check.Elsewhere, Jadaone keeps a keen eye for casting an ensemble of on-point performers. Annika Co exemplifies the right level of abrasiveness required in her ambiguous role. Meryll Soriano brings a calming presence as Sunshine’s steely coach. Elijah Canlas and Xyriel Manabat are also effective in their teenage archetypes. And Rhed Bustamante will probably haunt the viewers the most. But it is Jennica Garcia, as Sunshine’s older sister, who lends the most empathy for our titular heroine. You can tell that there's an entire backstory not explicitly stated in the script. Regardless, Garcia’s performance carries the weight of the unsaid history. “Sunshine” did not win the Crystal Bear for Best Film in the recent BIFF for nothing. Whatever reservations you have in the abortion issue, RH bill or the need for comprehensive sex education in the country, this film is a necessary addition in feminist cinema. It plays a pivotal role in stirring up conversations on women’s reproductive health. By focusing on the human stories of Sunshine and the countless women trapped in outdated laws, the discourse reaches political without any pretensions. It is one of Jadaone’s most incendiary works to date.",2025-07-29,1,0,watch,True

grcceries,8,"I LOVE THIS SO MUCH 🥹 two things: (1) you already know my gripe with movies nowadays being too self-aware, esp when making commentary on social issues (e.g. through infodump dialogues and/or in-your-face monologues). given the themes of this movie, i was initially scared that this'll end up having the same issue— but THANK GOD that wasn't the case here. this one actually took the effort to situate us in Sunshine's shoes. it knew how to convey Sunshine's story by fleshing out the world that she lives in, by showing how she relates to others, by showing us the things she does not do and does not say. this movie knows how to practice restraint! that's how it managed to really make Sunshine shine :D(2) i love that this movie makes a very decisive stance on abortion, without having uhhhh such a cold attitude towards children. like, never once did Sunshine change her mind about having an abortion, and this movie also made several strong cases about how motherhood disadvantages/endangers women— but it also makes it clear that the problem is not... the babies/children? in fact the children are also victims here, as shown in Ariana's case. instead of being shown as ~the problem~ pa nga, this movie instead shows us that children may symbolize hope and companionship and possibilities. the unwanted pregnancy made life difficult for both Menggay and Ariana— but wasn't it Ariana, still, who stood up for Menggay? what Sunshine went through throughout the entire film was difficult and isolating— but she wasn't exactly alone, was she? hindi man niya gusto 'yung bata, there was a part of her that sought comfort from the possibility of the child's companionship. i think it's just human nature, yenno, to seek connections from others when going through a difficult time. and when you live in a society where you can't disclose all these troubles to anyone, not even to those closest to you— whose companionship can you seek, if not your own flesh that's taking shape into another life? sino pa ba ang mas makakaintindi sa 'yo kundi ang sarili mong laman at dugo? yeah in practice that may not be true LOL kaya nga ipinaabort pa rin ni Sunshine eh xD kahit anong ""romantic"" ng notion na susuportahan ka ng anak mo anuman ang pangarap mo, that's practically impossible when its very existence is what could hinder you from reaching them lol. pero ayun nga, it's the difficulty of the situation and our human vulnerabilities that add nuance to these discussions.—some pro-choice people (and i know they mean well naman) like to claim that abortion is ok because it's just getting rid of some soulless clumps of tissue anyway. and i guess that's scientifically true... but if fetuses are rly just soulless clumps of tissue then why are we so afraid of pregnancy at all...? why do we want to do abortions as early as possible...? I MEAN LIKE, it's silly to keep dismissing the possibility of actual growing life when discussing these things. and the fact that Sunshine Did Not Do That makes this movie good and relevant and real and special and a must-must-must-must watch. i love this movie <33 i hope more people get to see it",2025-07-29,0,0,watch,True

jahdfaune,8,"The entire time I was watching, I felt like I couldn't breathe. It's claustrophobic and suffocating, just like how Sunshine herself feels. You feel her world slowly closing in on her, invisible walls tightening around her in every frame. The camera doesn't let you breathe, and neither does the sound. Manila's noise is constant, overwhelming, and disorienting, especially for a gymnast who needs focus and silence to thrive. Sunshine is literally and figuratively trapped in tight spaces, cramped jeepneys, crowded streets, the overbearing sound of trains passing by, judgmental stares, and high expectations. Visually and sonically, it captures how isolating and terrifying it is to carry a burden like hers in a society that is less than kind toward women. (Btw, just to put it out there, the cinematography and colors in this film are GORGEOUS.) In almost every film that tackles women's issues in the Philippines, you'll find this line repeated in many reviews here in Letterboxd: ""Ang hirap maging babae. At lalong mahirap maging babae sa Pilipinas."" It's because it's true. Every day, women here continue to fight for autonomy, for safety, for the right to choose themselves. We live in a deeply patriarchal and religious society that expects women to always put others first—especially family, be it their parents, siblings, or children—and shames them whenever something bad happens to them as if they brought it upon themselves. Society never asks the men who take advantage of women simply existing to change, rather it expects women to quietly endure. Bakit kailangang babae ang palaging mag-adjust? I appreciated how the film showed moments of solidarity between women, but it's sad how that's not always the case in real life.Exceptional performances from the entire cast, especially Maris Racal, who is tremendous in the titular role. From the start, she's completely convincing as an elite athlete and future Olympian: disciplined, focused, and has no room for error, as both her dreams and the dreams of others rest heavily on her shoulders. But it's in moments where Sunshine wrestles with fear, guilt, and inner conflict that Maris truly shines. She captures and presents the character's vulnerability so well. Also, as someone who always adored Jennica Garcia since her GMA days, I absolutely loved watching her quiet and subtle acting as Sunshine's sister.I said in my first review of Fan Girl that I hoped Direk Tonet would make an even braver film, and she did. Sunshine focuses and dives deep into the themes it introduces and stands firm in its critique—something that I felt was somehow lacking in Fan Girl. While some moments didn't always work for me and the magical realism elements sometimes took me out, I understand the choice. Part of me wishes it stayed more grounded and direct, but the “Gets ko na” scene near the end hit so hard that I stopped minding altogether. It's a great, important film and I hope it helps open up more discourse on women's reproductive rights in the country.Go see it in cinemas when you can. 📽️ SM City North EDSA Cinema 6",2025-07-28,0,0,watch,True

Sunshine falls under one of my most favorite genres: social commentary by simply showing girls just trying to live. You can see throughout the film that she’s just a girl. Asking Miggy for money, asking for help when she needs, acts on her impulse, has dreams and goals, using twitter and Reddit for research (#real), etc. She knows she can’t take care of a whole ass child right now, all she can (and she should) do is to chase her dreams and make a career out of it.Though you can also see that Sunshine doesn’t really hate the kid. She takes care of her the way she can– giving her money to get home, looking for her when she’s lost, protects her from adult themes (drinking, abortion, etc). So her decision at the end, it’s not because she hates the kid, it’s because she loves herself. With the limited choices she had, she made the most out of her youth And what’s so wrong with that?

migueltheangelo,8,""" Drown out the noise.""This line in the Sunshine struck me after watching the film. Noise is considered as a plot device in the film literally and figuratively. I like how the background music or the noise from the background is used to set the tone and mood of the film especially in scenes where Sunshine is walking or riding a jeep home. Noise in the film can also represent the doubts that fill her while practicing and self-righteous religious people who judge her actions throughout the film.The film is about a gymnast who plans to join the tryouts for the Olympics. However, she receives a result that is unexpectedly pregnant which can hinder her chances in getting in. Maris Racal is great in her role as Sunshine and I think that she embodies the role of a gymnast especially since she tried gymnastics to prepare for her role. There were scenes that were remarkable for me such as when she tries to hit a the mirror of a car after her boyfriend (played by Elijah Canlas) doesn't take responsibility for her pregnancy. I also loved the supporting characters as well. Despite their small roles, they made a mark for me. For instance, Jennica Garcia was impressive in her scenes with Maris Racal as her older sister. You can feel that she defends and protects her sister and stay by her side especially during her revelation that she is pregnant. Xyriel Manabat is no surprise for me since I admire her acting skills since she was a child actress. She is great as Sunshine's best friend. Annika Co, an upcoming child actress, is a scene stealer where she acts as a conscience to Sunshine. She is charming and witty in her role and I think the twist made sense to me in one scene.In addition to it being a sports drama, this film also tackled the themes of women's choice and abortion. These topics are considered sensitive and taboo in a dominant Catholic and conservative society. As a man, this film moved me and realize how hard it is to be a woman in a society wherethey are judged for having an autonomy in their body. In a third world country, healthcare is considered a privilege especially for the poor. Because of abortion being considered illegal and immoral, women are forced to resort to unsafe practices which can endanger them. It is shown in the film and I think it's interesting that it depicted two doctors: one which discriminates women because of her religious bias and one which tried to understand and helped another character in the film who turned to abortion. It's a sad reality, but I'm glad that this film will open conversations about themes like these.Overall, I find Sunshine an impressive film. I think this is Antonette Jadaone's best film so far. It's my second film that I've seen in cinemas and I'm grateful to witness it in the big screen because it is worth the watch there with its immersive experience. I was definitely looking forward to it since it's rare to watch a sports film which centers around gymnastics and it has been shown in film festivals abroad. I was worried that it won't be shown here because of how controversial it would be because of the stand of the Catholic Church and other religious sectors regarding abortion. I guess more people are more open-minded towards the topics unlike before. Aside from the acting, what I found compelling in the film is the cinematography and scoring which adds tension and mood to the it. Despite its limited release and pitted against two superhero films during its premiere, I really hope more people will get a chance to watch this movie. Even if it shows the harsh realities of life and in sports, I agree with other film critics that it also shows hope. There is Sunshine after the rain.",2025-07-28,1,0,watch,False
macnfilm,8,"Watching Sunshine wasn’t just watching a movie. Parang I was sitting beside a woman, listening to her story ng tahimik lang, pero sobrang bigat. It’s not easy to watch, but that’s exactly why it felt so real. What hit me the most was how the film didn’t try to be loud or preachy. The film doesn’t try to romanticize or a free promotion for abortion. It just let the silence do the work. Minsan iyak lang, minsan wala talagang salita. That makes it more powerful. Hindi ito simpleng kwento. It’s about pain, dreams, and mga choices na hindi talaga madaling pagpilian.Pero I have to say, may parts na medyo kulang for me. Sana mas dark yung cinematography, like Khalel 15 — gritty and raw. Lastly, hindi ito movie para sa lahat. But still, Sunshine gives us something real.

ronnivore,8,"It is refreshing to see such a brave filmmaker like Antoinette Jadaone take on such a taboo topic as this, and despite its obvious flaws, there is so much to be celebrated about ""Sunshine"". Her depiction of realist Manila within a predominantly Catholic albeit judgmental Philippines is strikingly affecting, and the first half of this in particular is a worthy showcase of great filmmaking. The plot device did take me out of the film from time to time, and I do not think it was necessary nor was it effective. Yet, what more can you ask for when you have such a riveting turn from Maris Racal, who puts forward a performance for the ages. Those around her are also excellent, particularly Jennica Garcia, who embodies so much heart and emotion in the little scenes that she is in. Could this have been a better film? Yes.

aphrod,8,"We are introduced to Sunshine through her warming up with other student-athletes and performing her routine for the upcoming Olympic team tryouts. Viewers can tell that her prowess and national team member status is a mix of talent and hard work, that even when she messes up halfway through, it doesn't make her any less of a great gymnast.When she first finds out that she is pregnant, the camera focuses on her hands tremble. But she immediately acts on it – searching for suspicious dealers for pills, telling the boy that knocked her up, and going to church to pray that the Lord takes away the being forming in her womb – even when we see glimpses of her trying not to lose her composure in the humid streets of Manila.The film shows and justifies Sunshine's reasons for wanting an abortion, even if the means available in the Philippines will harm her. She has dreams that can't be put on hold, and she clearly is a young girl with mannerisms and tendencies deemed ""immature"" – factors that do not make her fit to be a mother.But in a scene wherein she talks to a pastor (played by Piolo Pascual, who made everyone in my cinema gasp) that promises financial support throughout her pregnancy and motherhood, she rejects it. ""Ayoko maging nanay,"" she says, plain and simple.That was my favorite part of the film, because it felt cathartic to hear it. Although Sunshine had good reasons for the choices she makes, we must not need to have justified, valid, and layered reasons for wanting an abortion. Some of us do not want to be mothers and undergo the medical complications that come with carrying a child, just because.I hope that it has more time to stay in cinemas.

carlcuevas,8,"Sunshine (2025, Project 8 Projects)I acknowledge that there are a lot of things in life I take for granted as a cisgender man. In Antoinette Jadaone’s new film, Sunshine, she presents a flawed yet heartbreaking tale on the female cost of pregnancy.In the film, we follow nineteen-year-old Sunshine, who has dedicated most of her life, along with the support of her sister who was also a former gymnast, in rhythmic gymnastics and her pursuit to enter the Philippine team for the Olympics. However, several weeks before the National tryouts, Sunshine discovers that she got pregnant after a recent sexual encounter with her boyfriend.Stepping out of the theater, I realized how it’s so hard to be a woman, not just in the Philippines but in general. And pregnancy, one of the human experiences that only a cisgender woman can experience, and how much it impacts on their health, emotions, and even their dreams or aspirations - especially when it happens completely unplanned. All of these are further amplified in the situation here in the Philippines where sexual education is still not a priority, access to quality maternal care is expensive, and role of religion to beset unfair expectations towards women.Despite having a strong message, there are things in Sunshine that I wish had been improved on. I must admit I felt a bit cheated out because the movie was initially hyped as a sports movie focusing on gymnastics - the same way Rookie did for volleyball, but in the end was more of a character drama that whose lead character is a gymnast. I wish that Jadaone delved deeper on Sunshine’s motivations on why gymnastics is important to her because at how the story was written, Sunshine could’ve played any sport and the story would remain the same. Before I get called out, I know the movie’s true intention is a commentary on the state of female reproductive health in the Philippines, but I felt like it was just a missed opportunity to highlight the state of female sports in the Philippines, particularly gymnastics because Filipino sports movies are so rare. I also felt like that the script could’ve been tightened up a bit as the elements of magical realism introduced in the story (without going too much in spoiler territory) didn’t land as much in terms of story logic.As a follow-up to her lead starring role in 2023 movie Marupok AF, Maris Racal continues to be one of the promising actresses of her generation. And in Sunshine, she delivers one of her career best performances so far, especially at lengths her character goes through and in the dedication to train of the gymnastics segments of the story.Overall, Sunshine is not an easy watch because it doesn’t mince the hard truths of how it is living as a woman in the Philippines. And now with with the ongoing female reproductive health and sexual education discussion in the Philippines, Antoinette Jadaone offers a strong message on why it is imperative that protections for women’s health should be passed, and why the movie Sunshine deserves your time and your attention.However, irony that this movie can only be seen by a limited number of people because of its R16 rating as well as the unfair cinema practices in the Philippines, makes this even more frustrating.",2025-07-27,1,0,watch,False

Ang nagpalaylay sa storyline is not the open ending, but a rushed conclusion of the problem. Nasagot nga ba ang problema? Anong nangyari kina Miggy at Sunshine? Is ‘Ari-yun-uh’ also a personification that Sunshine only imagine, like Annika’s character? Hindi ko maramdaman ang father and son dynamic nina Elijah Canlas and Mr. Piolo Pascual. However, Piolo’s character, as Pastor Jaime could’ve been explained and discovered more, and not pressed in a few minute exposure. What stood out in the film were Maris, Jennica, Annika, and “Ariana”‘s portrayal. Also, Sunshine, due to her juvenile age, can be prone to misconception and misinformation. In a predominantly Catholic country wherein proper sex education and proper healthcare system are nowhere to be found, and practices are dictated by religion and morality, relying on social media platforms as search engines would mean that she’s susceptible to wrong notions of her reality, which may lead her to resort to the sudden decisions that she make. The debate between religion and choice is long-going in the Philippine context. If the international audiences accepted this film with open arms, it’s about time that the Philippines does the same, and the film’s message would transgress to those without an open mind and for those who are unawakened with the harsh realities that most “Sunshine” faces.",2025-07-27,0,0,watch,False

mfcarandang,8,"After two decades in the industry, Antoinette Jadaone has cemented her capacity to bend, direct, and write with different genres — the deconstruction of ekstras with Lilia Cuntapay, the ironic and hilarious takedown of cosmetic surgery industry with Belo-approved meta-comedy “Beauty in a Bottle,” and the dialogue-driven romantic hugot dramas with ‘Tadhana.” Without a doubt, Jadaone stands as one of the most vital voices in Philippine filmmaking today, consistently challenging conventions and pushing Filipino Cinema forward. In all her films, one thing that’s notable she's put women's voices at the forefront. She has since taken a pandemic pause after Fan Girl, but this has also led to her researching and diving deep into her most recent film, Sunshine. The film follows a student gymnast, Sunshine (Maris Racal), who discovers she’s pregnant just as she’s about to compete for the SEA Games. The film takes a surreal turn when she encounters a kid/ alter ego appears in crisis moments, reflecting her inner turmoil as she faces societal judgment.Throughout the film, Sunshine’s emotional arc—marked by anguish, desperation, and vulnerability—lays bare the reality where women’s access to safe choices is morally questioned and legally denied. This taboo isolates her: abandoned by friends and her partner, judged by doctors, and pressured by her coach to give up her dreams. Social stigma is one, but the films also highlights how poverty and consequently, sexual miseducation put into question the dignity of women. To be able to choose freely, is too high of a cost for Sunshine who has to deal with its social, financial, and legal repercussions. The film understands how for women in the fringes there’s little to no choice.The film is not without hope. Her sister, who’s a single mother, grounds Sunshine. Her alter ego serves as emotional salve during her many crises. And she also chances upon an underaged girl months into her pregnancy who reflects and echoes her experiences. In each of them, Jadaone realizes Sunshine’s future: to be a single mother, carry her pregnancy to term, and have a daughter. The film effectively wrestles with the nuances of her situation: to choose her dreams or be with a child. Ironically, Sunshine occasionally stumbles under the weight of its many themes: its surreal elements and side characters threaten to overshadow Sunshine’s emotional arc. It makes one wonder how better the film would have been had it just been, as the film title suggested, about Sunshine. Nevertheless, the film is a showcase of Jadaone’s confident vision.There’s this wonderful scene in the film of a maternity ward that just for brief moment became a community for pregnant women and mothers helping and supporting one another. It epitomizes the warmth that carries Sunshine forward: from isolation to solidarity, and from uncertainty to self-understanding. Parting with her past, she talks to her alter ego hoping she’d understand. They hug. To be understood that’s just what Sunshine needed.",2025-07-27,0,0,watch,True

vtcnscientist,8,"Late diary entry. It really is true that employment screws the cinephile in us. This is Jadaone's Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020) mixed with the magical realism of Jojo Rabbit (2020), and Brocka's depiction of Maynila as a harsh, predatory city that traps and exploits the marginalized. There's a night scene that was basically taken from a Brocka handbook, framing, camera movements, dialogue. I love Jadaone's growth as a filmmaker and this project shows how she matured in multiple filmic aspects, but more so on the commendable screenplay. The conversations felt realistic– something a Gen-Z would say in the present context. There's a clever and subtle critiquing done by adding the English-speaking scenes as well. As if they poke fun at the other contradictions in our postcolonial, patriarchal society now.Multiple ironies and contradictions lie in this film—the titular character's name doesn't coincide with her lived experiences, the vendor selling the religious images of Nazareno and Sto Niño also sells the abortion pills, how the people who claim to care for us are so quick to judge if situations do not align with their perspective or morality. Sunshine to me was a thought-provoking way of presenting a very evident issue in our Philippine society, and Jadaone made it brutally honest without lacking the compassion and clarity to bring about this story.I love how hopeful the ending was tbh. I know that this country has been so steeped in religious conservatism that even acknowledging how hopeful that ending was would raise flak—but this movie has done a great deal to create awareness and productive discussions on unwanted pregnancies. Sunshine was a confrontation of our modern maladies, something that very clearly threatens the health and future of women. That's another contradiction in itself, having a government by the people, for the people and yet it chooses to ignore the evident crises of its people. I digress. Gets kita, Shine.

justinaerys,8,"Although Sunshine (2024) advanced the conversation about abortion and body autonomy, one treatment of the film sets the conversation back.Don't get me wrong tho', it effectively presented difficult conversations within an already difficult subject. It doesn't just talk about abortion in the moral sense, but also its nuances—such as abuse and inaccessibility of healthcare, including both financial and policymaking aspects that rob women of the right to appropriate medical procedures.It also gave face to the concept of guilt through the personification of the unborn, embodied by the characters of the unnamed child and Ariana.But that very personification is where exactly the issue starts.The argument for the pro-choice position is the fact that life does not start at conception, but upon delivery. To personify unborn fetuses strengthens the narrative that abortion is murder. ""Murderer,"" as the unnamed child called Sunshine the moment abortion crossed her mind upon knowing that she's pregnant.But how much does this set the conversation back? Not a lot, really.The film did not fail in doing its job. By tackling abortion itself, it already succeeded in sparking conversations such as this one. And that's already a huge step in advancing women's right to accessible healthcare.Let's just hope that we'll get to see more ""woke indie films"" like Sunshine (2024).

ratatoumille,8,"“gets mo na ‘ko?” id like to believe that the kid was a depiction of sunshine’s conscience and its such a powerful statement to put out there — that sunshine didnt have anyone to convince but herself. that its okay as long as the choice was hers and not anyone else’s, especially in a society that often robs women the decision to make a choice in the first place.and despite the loud and often guilt-ridden noises that paralleled the packed and polluted streets of manila, it contested the catholic and cis-heteropatriarchal belief that the sole purpose of womanhood is motherhood and to choose to become someone else is to sin. but sunshine wouldn’t have come through all odds if it weren’t also for the women in her life that chose to show up for her. the only thing more powerful than the dangers that women are constantly subjected to, are the embrace of fellow women who just understand it. sunshine didn’t even have to utter a single word, her silence, both in her vulnerable and fearless moments, was heard. the quiet glances between her and thea, reassuring her that she is seen. her sister’s arms reaching out to her in bed, making her presence known and reminding sunshine that she’d never be alone, the gentle squeeze of menggay’s hands to let her know she’s safe. they all heard and seen each other, and having someone who’s willing to carry and share your burden with is enough for everything else to be bearable. gets na gets kita Sunshine, at sana mas marami pang mga pilipino ang makarinig at makaintindi sa’yo at sa kuwento mo.",2025-07-26,4,0,watch,True

mobirebyu,8,"“Gets ko na.”In this film, we follow Sunshine, a rhythmic gymnast and an Olympic hopeful, as she travels through Manila’s dark, narrow, grimy, and crowded streets and alleys in search of a way to terminate her pregnancy in a country where abortion is illegal. There are few parts of this film that really stood out to me because they made elevated the movie and made it more compelling.The first part that I really liked is how the city became a living representation of this country’s oppressive stance against anything pro-abortion. The city allowed us to have something tangible, to be able to relate to Sunshine’s struggles even more. Second, the magical realism aspect is also a highlight for me. Once it finally clicked what Ariana and Annika Co’s characters represented, I was blown away. One common argument of those against abortion is that you are going to kill someone who’s probably gonna be a very important person. And yet, we get Annika Co’s character. Through a very powerful performance we end up caring for this kid. But once you start to realize who she us and who she represents, you start to realize that she’s not just an extension of Sunshine but a representative of all babies born to mothers forced to carry a child. She and these babies are vessels forced to carry the unfulfilled dreams of their mothers. She said something like, “Ang pangarap niya ay ang pangarap ko.” And that line broke me. The argument is always, “We are not fulfilling someone’s potential if we abort them.” but there’s always a failure to acknowledge that forcing someone to bear a child is also not allowing them to fulfill their potential.The last part that stood out to me is Maris Racal’s great performance. She is the movie. Without that performance, this film will fall apart and she delivers. What this film did is humanize a debate that’s usually so contentious it ends up being too one dimensional. It made the debate more accessible to every one. The movie is unflinching and raw. A harsh criticism of a society and culture who despite being always proud of their women, continues to fail them by continuing to enabling oppressive systems that mostly targets women. A big middle finger to a society that still strongly reeks of misogyny. It also an exploration of the country’s broken healthcare system. This film is a celebration of female friendships and sisterhood. The people who helped Sunshine in her journey are women. It forces you to be uncomfortable. It forces you to think and have empathy.

roguism,8,"This movie is so satisfying to watch because it empathizes with its main character, sunshine, a young gymnast training for the olympics who happened to have an unwanted pregnancy. Young women like her are figures often shunned in popular philippine media and well, society so it’s refreshing to see someone like her in a sympathetic light. Abortion is such a taboo topic in this country so i very much appreciate the relentless uncovering of the different failures of the government and society with regards to women’s reproductive health and rights. Props to Maris for fearlessly embodying the role. Abortion is healthcare. It should be a choice accessible to anyone that wants it. It doesn’t have to be earned which is why I do find the imaginary kid representing sunshine’s conscience or the possible “kid” she might bear in the future unnecessary and redundant in the face of all the other oppressive opinions surrounding her. If the goal was to voice her inner worries, it wasn’t needed, it was already felt and would’ve been better shown some other way. If the goal was to voice the external conservative audience’s thoughts, then it wasn’t needed as well because they’re already thinking it, the film should’ve been secure with putting its faith on Sunshine alone. She’s a woman and she has dreams and having a baby is not part of that. She has value still for just the fact of being a person. I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way. It’s a very beautiful film nonetheless, shining best in its moments of truth and courage.",2025-07-25,0,0,watch,False

ajduyac,8,"Some films entertain you. Sunshine confronts you.When the credits rolled, no one moved. No one spoke. It was that rare kind of silence. Not awkward, but sacred. As if we had all just witnessed something painfully true and didn’t quite know what to do with ourselves.Because Sunshine isn’t just a movie. It’s a question. A confrontation. Directed with clarity and deep compassion by Direk Tonet Jadaone, Sunshine doesn’t soften its message or try to make it more palatable.. It’s brave. It’s loud in its honesty. It doesn’t ask for permission to be angry or tired or vulnerable. It simply is, and that’s why it hits the way it does. And yet, somehow, even with all its emotional weight, Direk Tonet’s signature humor still finds its way through. There are moments—unexpected but perfectly timed—when the entire cinema bursts into laughter. It’s sharp, it’s honest, and it never feels out of place. Maybe Direk Tonet makes us laugh because she knows we’ll cry eventually. Or maybe that’s just how we are as Filipinos, finding humor even in the heaviest moments, because sometimes, it’s the only way we know how to carry the pain.What makes this film even more powerful is how it gives voice to things we often overlook. As someone who isn’t a woman, I know I can’t fully grasp the weight of that experience. But this film opened a window for me. A clear, honest glimpse into a reality I will never live, but need to see. Much of that power comes from the performances. Maris Racal, as Sunshine, delivers the most vulnerable and grounded work of her career. Her pain is quiet, but it radiates. You feel it in the way she holds her breath between words, in the weight behind her gaze. Jennica Garcia, as her sister, is just as affecting. Her stillness, her softness, the way she listens. She becomes a reflection of what the film asks of us: to pause, to witness, to respond with care. There’s a moment near the end that stuck with me. Sunshine asks, “Gets mo na ba ako?”And while it’s said to the person in the room, it felt like she was looking straight through the screen, asking us, the viewers. And like that person beside her, I hope we all have the courage to say: Yes. We see you. We understand.Please, Direk Tonet, keep making films like this (inutusan pa nga). Keep telling stories that hold space for women to be everything—loud and quiet, strong and hurting, tired and brave. Stories that make people feel seen.Gets kita, Sunshine.",2025-07-24,15,0,watch,True

She takes you in and makes you feel her struggles. Her facial nuances and physical vigor makes her the right choice to play the titular role, in what could be a role of a lifetime. Director Antoinette Jadaone's never been more sure and absolute of her vision here. The film stands as an audacious statement in a country full of naysayers when it comes to the sensitive and controversial subject matter: abortion. The ending really made me shed a tear, in response to understanding why women do what they do. Though the film is not without its flaws. I sometimes felt the script and characters could have been more seamlessly sewn, and not just coming out of nowhere, making it feel a bit unnatural. Nevertheless, this is an essential film that needs to be seen by a wide audience.

_filmonella,8,"Antoinette Jadaone has always been one of the few Filipino filmmakers I deeply admire, not just for her craft, but for the way she tells women’s stories with empathy and nuance. Her work has always felt personal, films like Alone/Together, Fan Girl and now Sunshine, might just be my favorite Filipino film released this year so far.I remember seeing the trailer last year and wondering if it would even get a proper release here. It tackles such a taboo topic, one that many in this country still refuse to even speak about. That’s why I admire Jadaone so much. She’s chosen to talk about what others won’t. In a predominantly Catholic nation where abortion is criminalized, even in cases of rape or incest, Sunshine feels like an act of courage.I’ve always been pro-choice. I grew up surrounded by the whole “abortion is murder” narrative, from relatives, from my old Catholic school run by nuns. But even as a kid, it never sat right with me. I never saw it as a sin. And now that I’m studying to become a doctor, that belief matters even more to me, because women deserve healthcare that doesn’t judge or shame them. Sunshine affected me on a personal level because of that. It reminded me why I want to do this.It’s not a perfect film. Some might find the pacing fast or feel like it didn’t say enough. But to me, the point isn’t perfection. What matters is that it exists. It dares. It’s a film that opens doors, uncomfortable ones, sure, but necessary.

newrev,8,"Sunshine is a statement. Raw, delicate, and bold. It presents a social commentary on themes rarely explored yet deeply prevalent in the Philippine context. It dares to be radical. It dares to draw the line. When does the sun finally shine in a morally gray cloud of social disapproval?As linear and straightforward as the film appears, beneath it lies a complex character study — fearlessly told, thematically sharp, and emotionally unsettling. Antoinette Jadaone writes for women, and in a cinematic landscape like ours, we need more voices like hers. I was initially worried about where the story would go, but it was brave enough to take the harder path.This is Maris Racal's best performance yet — nuanced and quietly powerful. But it was Jennica Garcia who stole every scene she was in. She was the emotional anchor, the tearjerker. Some casting choices outside the leads, however, fell short. Certain scenes and narrative decisions could have landed harder with stronger performances or more fitting direction.That said, the editing needs work. The presence of a stunt double in certain scenes is obvious, breaking immersion. While the film’s visuals hauntingly capture a side of Manila we rarely see on screen, the sound design lacks polish. These flaws are noticeable but not deal-breaking.Still, this film succeeds in doing what few others do: it makes you ask what is ethical and what is not. It invites reflection.
