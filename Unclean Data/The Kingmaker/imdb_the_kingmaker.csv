This is the truth,"This documentary perfectly captured the experiences of the Marcos and the exploited people. It showed what it is like to live with extensive wealth and how the Marcos regime used it for political power and their self interests.

This is a must watch film for those who wish to see the Marcos' perspective on Martial Law and their countless political movements.

This documentary shows the truth, through direct interviews with the Marcoses, and it is up to you if you are going to believe it. As John Henry Newman would say: ""We can believe what we choose but we are answerable for what we choose to believe.",9
Prescient and illuminating,"As I write Ferdinand Marcus junior or 'bong bong' has been elected president of the Philippines, so it's a good time to view this documentary about the Marcos dynasty, its rise, its fall in the peoples revolution of 1986, and the gradual and dramatic rise again of its fortunes; in particular this film focuses on the surprisingly influential, some might say malevolent role that Imelda Marcos played. It's a shocking tale of shameless corruption nepotism cronyism and greed, at the end of which one can only feel saddened for the Filipino people, who have been used abused lied to and robbed over decades by their elite, and still are. Half of todays Filipino voters were not alive for the first Marcos era, but I was there in late 1985 and saw the huge disparity between the rich and poor, and just how hated the Marcos regime was at the time. Sadly all of that now seems to have been forgotten. If you want to know something of the true story of the Marcos 'dynasty' see this fine doc.",8
"Privilege matters, Political horror!",Well worth watching. Amazing documentary about privilege and the sociopathic mindset. It's about a narcissistic self serving former first lady abusing her position. The film shines on the ugly politics of the Philippines.,9
Excellent insight into vile monsters !,"I love the Philippines, visited many times and my longterm gf is there. The carnage left behind from this disgusting dynasty is there for all to see today in the form of vastly stunted economic growth down to the billions of dollars embezzled by these creatures !

This documentary is wonderfully put together but leaves me sad to see a country I am so fond of suffering even today from what these two people did ! Her state of mass delusion is clear for all to see in this excellent piece of work !",10
Real life political horror,"Horrifically illustrates how a nation's collective memory can be erased in real time and the true limits of democracy in the social media age.

I liked how it started off making us think it was going to be a lifestyles of the rich and famous and slowly peeled away the facade and leaves you with the punch to the gut. Imelda comes across as a complete psychopath with absolutely no perception of reality. This is what happens to you when you drink your own kool-aid folks!

In a world where social media can be manipulated to create alternate realities, these historical revisionists will find it even easier to get away with murder. God help us all.",10
Very intersting despite being ruined,"It is a story of how corruption enters a nation and stays there forever. The documentary is very intersting in this aspect. The maker of the documentary is very one sided and has little knowledge of the local culture. This is of course very irritating. She paints the obvious corrupt opposition as saints. Anyone wiht any knowledge about that culture should know how stupid the maker of this docu is. Apart from that, a very interesting documentary worth watching.",6
"""Perception is Real and the Truth is NOT""","With the Marcoses' consistent effort to rewrite history, this documentary reminds us that behind the grandeur and elaborate schemes of the Marcoses are the stories of pain and sorrows of the victims, which are not mere perception but the truth. As Greenfield's style is apparent in the documentary, it did not fail to capture the depressing history of the Philippines under the Marcoses and what may be an apparent future if they were put again into position. The contrasting images presented by Greenfield is a great divider between Perception and Reality.",9
The Kingmaker - Film Review,"The Kingmaker is a documentary written and directed by Lauren Greenfield. The film follows the political career of Imelda Marcos from the start of her political career with her husband Ferdinand Marcos, the fall of their power and exhile to Hawaii, and then their resurgence after her husbands death and rise of the political career of her children - especially her son Bongbong Marcos.

This film does a good job of contrasting the story Imelda portrays versus the reality of those under her rule. Imelda will say how great her husbands reign was. Then you have individuals speak about the atrocities of what occurred. I found the film very informative as someone who did not know about the subject matter going in.

I also appreciated how the film showed the current scene of the Philippines with Bongbong running for Vice-President (and who is President as I write this 6 years after the film came out).

Overall, I think this is a worthwhile watch to learn about the history of the Philippines political dynasty from 1965 - 1986, and then again around 2016. - 7/10.",7
Uncovering the Fantasy World of the Marcoses,Brilliant documentary. It shows how much you can do with money; it can turn lies to history.,9
An eye opener,"Highly recommend this. Like her or loathe her you can't deny the blatant pesos for politics. Watching Marcos hand out wads of cash to kids in a hospital ward in front of the cameras was as cynical as it was sickening.

I've never paid much (read: any) attention to Filipino politics but will be following along the 2022 election with interest!",8
Dark truths are there if your eyes are open,"This is an incredibly well put together documentary. Imelda Marcos doesn't exactly shoot herself in the foot - she is too smart to do that, but you nonetheless get to see the realities she so flagrantly ignores whilst living in her self made fantasy world. How many billions has this power crazed matriarch squirreled away in 140 countries across the world. There are only 8 and a bit billion people on the planet and handing each one a single dollar might seem like generosity but this very much hides the manipulations of the Marcos clan. We note other world leaders seem to be in the same exclusive club as this gurning despot. Lord help us all.",8
Outstanding and riveting documentary,"""The Kingmaker"" (2019 release; 100 min.) is a documentary about the life and times of Imelda Marcos, erstwhile First Lady of the Philippines (1965-1986). As the movie opens, we are in ""Manile, 2014"", and Imelda is visiting the old neighborhood (the Presidential Palace). ""I miss the clout of being First Lady"", she laments, while wondering if her appearance and make-up for the interview is ok. We then go back in time, as we look at her very modest upbringing until she catches the eye of Ferdinand Marcos while in a beauty contest. Before we know it, they marry and Marcos vies to become President of the Philippines... At this point we are 10 min. into the documentary.

Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from writer-director Lauren Greenfield, best known for her 2012 documentary ""The Queen of Versailles"". Here she seemingly gets unfettered access to Imelda and her entourage, and she lets Imelda tell her side of the story, one in which of course Imelda is but a shining bright star in the darkness that is the Filipino sea of poverty. The great thing is that Greenfield doesn't have to ""manufacture"" anything: Imelda does it for her! Greenfield of course give ample screen time to opposing views, including survivirs of the Martial Lawera (1972-1980), during which torturing was rampant, And oh, lest we forget: the Marcoses stole an estimated $8-10 billion (with a ""b"") while in office. And if all of this isn't enough, Greenfield follows the Vice Predential election campaign in 2015-16 of Bongbong Marcos (son of Imelda), which itself becomes as revelating as anyting (just watch!). When confronted with issues of ""ill-gotten wealth"", Imelda simply shrugs it off (as does Bongbong). ""Perception is real, and the truth is not"", she states as a matter of fact. Hmmm, where have we heard this elsewhere in recent times? Bottom line: ""The Kingmaker"" is an oustanding and riveting documentar, period.

""The Kingmaker"" premiered on Showtime in 2019, which I somehow missed, but I recently caught it on Showtime on Demand and it is available on other VOD platforms too. If you have any interest in ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"", or how depots fleece an entire country for decades, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",8
insight in something unseen,Interesting story about something i knew nothing about. a political insight in a very important story of a world in unbalance.,10
I wish this would be played in schools...,"You can find it in YouTube FOR FREE, this documentary was not made for malicious purposes. The Marcos family themselves tell the story, not some director who can't even do their research properly.",10
Marcos Heist,"One line that caught me off guard is what Bongbong's son said about his career.

Cause you know he wanted to do Physics, Math, Biology. But my grandfather (the late president) is like ""There's no money in that, switch to Politics""

That explains a lot about their family.

Precise and well-researched documentary.",9
It's not about shoes!,Loved The Kingmaker! One of those docs that start out one way and slowly reveal another darker side. And also one of those subjects so sure of themselves that they have no problem saying things that are incriminating. Imelda reveals a lot without caring. The correlation between her and Trump are closer than you think!,8
It's not a surprise that the marcoses is paving the way for their return to power,"This movie's purpose is to reclaim the narrative that the Martial Law is the ""Golden Age"" of the Philippine politics but it sure as hell backfire to them. The movie/documentary is well research, balanced and no biases towards any of the personality featured. Fact checking is evident towards any of the claims by Imelda that none was killed nor tortured that only good things happened during the regime. Personally, growing up I love reading especially history about Philippines so its not a surprise to me that the Marcos regime is bad but this information is inaccessible to everyone unless you specifically look for it and the gov't provided textbooks is riddled with wrong information.

Its now 2022 and the presidential election is coming and the son's dictator is running for the highest position against the same person who beats him during the 2016 vice presidential election. The tide is changing this time because of the emergence of young voters gearing towards the new wave of politicians but its harder to fight for votes knowing that the machinery handling them is leaning towards the Marcoses.

This movie helped me get to know what type of person Imelda and their family. Their tagline Babangon Muli is not for the filipino people suffering for the effects of COVID-19, its for their family to go back to the Malacañan Palace and get back the power and clear their names from all the charges.",8
Excellent Documentary,"To all the people believing in somebody coming in and just giving away crumbs to make you shut up and just stop complaining, while they are living the grand life with money stolen from you and your countryman ...this documentary is a pearl. You just can see how they really are. True selves because they can't help it.",10
Marcos Regime the darkest in Philippines history,My opinion: The Marcoses siphoned and plundered the country's fund and Imelda is convicted with graft and corruption but she wasn't jailed because sadly that's how the justice system works for the powerful. Beautiful documentary.,10
Became president to maximize wealth,"Imelda said it herself. Marcos wanted to be president because he wanted to maximize his wealth and talent when a president supposedly gets fewer pesos than a private entity execs.

This documentary offers an interesting take on the Marcoses. It serves as a prelude to the current political landscape in the Philippines. It brings two contrasting narration of events but with a nice treatment where the viewer, no matter how naive, will understand who's telling the truth.

This modern take on story telling is designed for the youtube generation. It quickly moves from one topic to the other so as to keep the audience attention. Didnt waste any minute.

Thank you for this documentary. Every Filipino should watch this.",10
Corruption Unraveled,The Marcos regime is one of the most corrupt in the history of Philippine politics. This is truly and eye opener. I'd recommend for you to watch this.,9
Imelda shines a light!,"This documents the darkest side of human nature. The Kingmaker shines a light on those who wish only wealth and power, and don't care how they get it. These narcissists are totally out of touch with reality, the ends totally justifies the means. The correlation between her and Hillary Clinton are closer than you think!",8
Top directing,"The great thing about this documentary is the way it switches after the first hour,from feeling sorry for the monster that is Imelda to feeling disgust...but not only that,listening to the people who have tried to change things and their punishment thearafter trying to defend what is arguably one of the most beautiful places on earth...",10
