kathkaesque,7,"""Perception is real, the truth is not."" - Imelda Marcos in The Kingmaker (2019)This statement right here can sum up the propaganda that the Marcoses is instiling to the people (since the 1990s), the history that they are trying to deny, distort, and dispose, and their service that was never for the Filipinos but for those who are in their exclusive class (most highlighted by Marcos' quote about public service being a chore).Other than the Marcoses' edifice complex, the extravaganza, and their lavish lifestyle, Imelda's quote about giving birth to the world is one of her notable [ambitious] quest in the documentary. The tone during the segment where she [indirectly] states ""love conquers all"" while the extrajudicial killings during the Martial law as well as the contrast between the poor and the rich who uses them as ""props to display performative authenticity"" for their campaign played perfectly juxtaposed Imelda's quest. How can you call someone a mother who thinks that hurting one is a form of love? How can a mother treat those animals who she banished from their homeland and caged them in Calauit Islands to make a sort-like Noah's Ark paradise while she cast away those people who truly lived in the island from the start? How can be a supposedly loving mother be so cruel? Until today, the historical revisionism, distortion, denialism, and misinformation ran rampant. There should be a mandatory course or subject in elementary and in high school that will explain what happened in the 70s and until today. And not just with a paragraph [like in modules/book] that one can overlook and skip but with the details that engaged to the essence of the terror of corruption [checked by professionals in the field of history].The people like you shall not look for the stars through the luxury that was bought with taxpayers' money but through the grounds where you stand, through the land that was invaded, freed, and invaded again by its own people, and through people like you who yearns for a tomorrow where one can exist without worrying for their basic human rights and where the government truly served what it is mandated to be.But before you can look above the stars, you must open your eyes with the real truth initially below your radar. #NeverAgain#NeverForget#JusticeforMartialLawVictims#JusticeforEJKVictims",2025-12-02,3,1,watch,True

Writing an “easy” review simply means pointing out how the resurgence of authoritarian legacies is happening everywhere, and how films like this serve as warnings to the public. That’s a straightforward approach. But I can’t shake the feeling that if we rely solely on films to revive fear of past atrocities, the effect may actually backfire.

angelobosita,2,"[Nov 2025 edit]Changed my rating to lower it. A political documentary like this cannot be viewed superficially. Regardless how good the production value is, we shouldn't give platform to the Marcoses for them to tell more lies to our faces. Additionally, it doesn't sit well with me how foreigners seem to feature one of the darkest moments in our country's history as just another interesting subject for a documentary especially when this was shot and released during the Marcoses' return to power.Yes, it may have shown Imelda's bullshit and the effects of their corruption. But they were still given a microphone to blast their lies into. I think Philbert Dy said it best in his review:""There are no two sides when telling the story of the Marcoses. They stole from the country, and tortured and killed thousands of people. Somewhere along the way, the film seems to come to the realization that Imelda isn't the harmless old biddy that they thought she was. But it's too late. They talked to her, and gave her yet another chance to say the vile things she's always been saying.""",2020-03-22,0,0,watch,False

letterchie,7,"it deeply frustrates me that people aren’t as angry as they ought to be towards the Marcos family. this includes those who recognise their wrongdoings but simply sit back, because such lenience is what allowed the Marcoses to once again set foot on Philippine soil with no punishment. I hold no remorse when I say that, even at her age, Imelda deserves to bide what time she has left behind bars. literal piles of documents and other forms of evidence, yet nothing has been done? it’s even worse when people say phrases such as “God will judge (the Marcoses) when their time comes” ... I do not say this because of my lack of faith, but no human will ever be certain of what comes after, so how can we trust that they shall face their sins? why can’t we enact justice while they are still around? while there are still living witnesses to their crimes?I appreciate the subtle humor in allowing Imelda to spew lies, then immediately placing true, opposing statements right after (ex. when Imelda claimed that no people lived on Calauit island, followed by residents themselves speaking on how they were displaced). but I feel that this documentary was hesitant in really digging into the nasty details. these are general facts we already know (afterthought: I’ve realised that this documentary serves as an introduction for foreigners. still, it is not as critical as it could be). some may come out of this still having a neutral or even positive opinion on the Marcos family, especially with Imelda posing herself as this elegant peacemaker when she is nothing of the sort. the Marcoses think they are royalty when every bit of high-class society they got to experience was only made possible through the ill-gotten wealth of the masses.",2022-12-31,1,0,watch,False

scoozig,9,"A really really good documentary.I learned a lot about the history of my maternal country which I admittedly only knew surface level before. It didn't go super super deep into every historical aspect as this was more of a character study of Imelda, the charming, manipulative, flamboyant, delusinal first lady behind some of the worst years of philippine dictatorship. But it does go into the present day as well as talk about some of the atrocities of the Marcos dictatorship period. It makes me sad knowing that the country is LITERALLY repeating history because people haven't learned from the mistakes of the past-- because it isn't taught and propaganda is powerful. It also makes me sad to see the parallels between the US and the Philippines in this regard. Also gross to see how the US has its hands in the pies of foreign govts. Like we know that already but yeah it's just gross. This was filmed before bongbong became president and it warns us that it's coming and it's frustrating and infuriating.Anyway. I really think Imelda believes her job is to mother everyone, to mother the country. I think she really believes that is her purpose. But she's an abusive mother. She doesn't care about the needs of her children.Anyway going to high school in the Philippines was crazy bc I've literally been at the same parties as the children of these politicians and dictators. Like literally Gossip Girl Philippines. It's disgusting to think about the wealth disparity and the pain that some of these people have brought on the country.",2025-10-30,3,1,watch,True

kianur,10,"“Perception is real, the truth is not”I watched this documentary way back on December 25, 2022—the same year when Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late dictator, won the presidential election. During that time, I was still grieving (and honestly, I still am) over the fact that despite his family’s wickedness, despite their crimes against the Filipino people—his son still managed to win.I was new to these things back then, and English was still a challenge for me. But when I heard Imelda Marcos utter those words, my jaw dropped. Every word that comes out of this woman’s mouth is either a lie, arrogance, delusion, or fabrication. It’s ironic that they gave her the benefit of the doubt, but it turns out to be a reason for us to hate her even more. As the saying goes, you can catch a fish by its mouth—and in this case, her words alone expose how filthy, hideous, and wicked she is.Although I was still new to in-depth politics during that time, I was shocked by how she spoke about some of the worst politicians of her era with such pride and admiration. Not to mention how rich she became, not through hard work or service, but through theft disguised as glamour.She’s delusional. You’re not mothering—Imelda, you’re manipulating.P.S. That Picasso painting cameo? It would send you to a coma. Just imagine how much money they stole, all because she wanted her life to be “Imeldefic.”",2025-10-26,2,0,rewatch,True

zugzw4ng,8,"What I love the most about Lauren Greenfield’s films is that she lets her subject and the material speak so clearly that you can understand everything that she’s implying. The film opens up with Mrs. Marcos driving through an impoverished street in the Philippines, looking sorrowful covered in designer clothing and pieces of jewelry that could probably remake the entire neighborhood. She takes out her wallet and hands out 50 pesos to each of the residents who clamor to her window once they see who she is and what she has in her hands. Her hands move with the precision of a Coin-o-matic, only dispersing one crisp bill per person. This is all she can manage to provide and all she thinks the deserve. The film documents the atrocities, glamour, abuses, and scandal of the Marcos regime while covering Bong Bong Marcos’s bid for vice president. The parallels to America’s current fascist regime are apparent. The image of Mrs. Marcos that emerges is that she never grew out of the child who was abandoned by her mother and was not taught the true meaning of love. Love to her is money and show, not progress. Those who do not know the meaning of love cannot give it.",2025-09-25,3,0,rewatch,True

jamesevo,10,"“Perception is real and the truth is not,” words from a woman who was essentially the face of the darkest moments in Filipino history. This documentary was not just meant to inform the people; it was a warning a warning that the sins of the past would come back to haunt the Filipino people, and they have. In recent months, the Philippines has been marred by controversies involving ghost projects and corrupt officials. Yet, after speaking with many people about this matter, one question always prevails: How? How did the corruption, plunder, and blatant theft from the Filipino people become so severe?Upon watching this, the answer became clear as day: it is because we allowed those who started the problem to get away with it. We, as Filipinos, glorified the rich and powerful, while the poor who fought back were treated as criminals. The rich became gods, the supposed benefactors of the poor, when in truth, what they gave was only a fraction of what they had stolen. The Marcoses became the blueprint of Philippine corruption today. They set the rules on how to plunder the people. To fix this issue, we must first hold accountable those who began it in the first place.Democracy no longer truly exists in the Philippines, for it has long been the government against the people ever since the Marcoses were allowed back into the political landscape. Forgetting the past horrors, terrors, and sins has only allowed history to repeat itself. It may not always be under the same name or family, but it is carried out in the same way. If we want change, we must believe that it is not a question of when but of how. We must commit to a long-term process of change, not fall for empty promises. A nation cannot be built in a day, and solutions to systemic issues will never materialize in just a few years.Despite all this, I remain optimistic that these recent issues of corruption will open the eyes of those who were once blinded by words and false promises. The Filipino people should no longer be bound by biased perceptions; we are slowly beginning to see the truth. We are being played and I hope these events will finally serve as the catalyst for change: a change in governance, a change in mentality, and a change for the betterment of the Philippines.",2025-09-21,1,0,watch,False

hello_lorenzo,10,"""Now is what's important, so the past is past. There are so many things in the past that we should forget. In fact, it's no longer there.""The first time I saw this documentary was in early-2020. I was in the living room with my parents, my tita and my lola; they were all alive during Martial Law. I recall how annoyed my family were as Imelda talked about her side of the story and how ""sad"" it was to see the country turn their backs on the Marcoses. Even then, perhaps due in part to my family's influence, I was heavily critical of the Marcoses and their claims, as well as the rhetoric of then-president Rodrigo Duterte.This was months before the pandemic that was poorly addressed by Duterte's administration, three years before Bongbong would be elected straight to the presidential seat, and six years before Duterte would be charged with crimes against humanity by the ICC and sent to the Hague while his followers claimed that he was ""unjustly arrested"".I love the way that this documentary was shot. The juxtaposition of the lavish Marcos spendings with the effects they have had on the lowest sectors of society do a good job at providing insight into the sheer amount of ill-gotten wealth they have procured over the years. The intimate interviews we get from this documentary are also a huge highlight for me. It makes me wonder how the crew were able to get so many high-profile people for this documentary.In retrospect, it is almost horrible foreshadowing to see all this talk of BBM's race to vice presidency when he is currently our president. It's like he got what he wanted and more. What does it say about us as a country that we are willing to let the son of a dictator and kleptocrat, as well as their family, back into power? Or rather, what does it say about our education systems and efforts to retain the facts of the Martial Law era?To still see the Marcos family in power shows that they really did essentially get away almost scot-free. At this point in time, it is more imperative than ever to never forget what their dynasty has done to our country, and to never again repeat the mistakes of the past. I am thankful that from a young age, my family's stories and experiences living under the Marcos regime have been instilled in me. I am thankful that I have people in my life to make sure that I remember our history.",2025-04-19,0,0,rewatch,True

mariakrishna,5,"i've watched this too many times but the initial feeling has never left. it's one thing to have a white director try to spell out the bloody history of a country she's never known, it's another to give Imelda the platform and attention she's always had in abundance but still seem to feel like she lacks. which is pretty much appropriate considering her insatiable desire not only for attention, but also power and glory.but i guess only a white director could have ever stepped foot in their mansion, could have used her prestige and privilege to make the interview feel like flattery despite it being a portrait of a murderous family, could have gotten the funding to even make this possible.i am torn between two things: on the one hand, my background in Psychology has me looking at everything as a case study, and what is more interesting than a powerful family who built their fortune and influence on violence? on the other hand, was it necessary to screen this in the middle of a then-impending (now real) Marcos Jr. presidency, and expect a divided nation to discern for themselves when things could be so easily taken out of context–especially those under the false illusion of the absolute goodness of the Marcoses, looking only for what will reinforce their perceived truths?i had faced the dilemma of being in the middle of it all, as at that time i was working in an artist collective that organized an annual film festival, which had this at the center of the programming. we also organized screenings and talkbacks in different areas in the country, but make no mistake: it was an ethical dilemma for everyone involved. how will it live beyond its 2-3 year festival circuit lifespan? how will it be viewed as it is, a decade later, without the talkback discussions and with all of the Martial Law survivors gone?there are thousands, if not millions, of stories that are yet to be told. in my hometown i can recall a few quite easily, with the remnants of the dictatorship still very much alive in every corner of our island. it does not help that Imelda is centered in this narrative. it does not help that the victims and survivors in the documentary felt more like a testament to the power of the Marcos family than the actual holders of this historical narrative.this should not have been the story of Imelda but the story of the Filipino people who have fought against the seemingly immovable force of the dictatorship. this should have been a portrait of the force that moved against them and carved out a victory.i respect the director's focus on cinematic monographs, but at the end of the election cycle that decided a Marcos presidency, we got the answer to the ethical dilemma: no, this film did not move the needle towards the downfall of the Marcos family like we hoped it would. they are back in the highest seat of power, and all we have is a humanized portrait of Imelda and an intellectual discourse that we pass back and forth until it is worn and tired, while the rest of our people survive on scraps after the Marcoses took everything they could.",2019-08-30,1,0,watch,False

eudorafletcher,7,"Portrait of one of the most irresponsible politicians you can imagine. Imeldas husband Ferdinand Marcos was democratically elected in 1962 and declared martial law in 1972. Freedom of the press was abolished and all opposition was nipped in the bud. The couple enriched themselves privately from the tax revenue and have been declared as secondary corrupt government by Transparency International at the time. In 1983, unknown killers shot the opposition politician Benigno Aquino at Manila airport, which led to increasing resistance among the population. When Corazon Aquino stood for election in 1986, Marcos had the results manipulated and declared himself the winner. Because of unrest among the population, the Marcos family had to flee - to the USA, where they lived in a palatial house in Hawaii with a good state pension. Imelda continued to claim that her husband was the Philippines' best leader, despite the couple's embezzlement of billions of US dollars (they believed the money belonged to them as leaders of the country!).She returned to the Philippines in 1991 and received a seat in the House of Representatives there. She campaigned (successfully!) for her son, who has been President of the Philippines since 2022. It is just as incomprehensible how it happens that Imelda is repeatedly acquitted in the (Philippine) courts.Imelda was willing to be interviewed for the documentary. The woman clearly lives in a parallel reality in which she was the kind mother of Filipinos and always did everything for the good of her country. At the same time, people who knew her talk about her blatant spending: She bought several houses in NYC and founded a small safari park on a supposedly uninhabited island. The 250 families who lived there were simply expelled. This park still existed in 2019, but has now become quite run down due to a lack of funding. The residents who have since returned are having a hard time dealing with the zebras and giraffes that are eating away at their gardens. boxd.it/bZCw2",2025-02-18,9,0,watch,False

In fact, it's no longer there.""While I am against giving out-of-touch, manipulative liars platforms, there is something extra damning about hearing Imelda Marcos' version of events directly from her addled memory. She tries to come off as this sad, compassionate, motherly figure who only wanted what was best for the Philippines. But then she slips up on her words and the truth comes out. She admits that her husband wanted to become president to maximize his wealth. She says ""When you lose your money... I mean mother..."" Was that a Freudian slip? They convince themselves that removing people from their homes, stealing and hoarding the wealth of the country, and martial law were all great successes ""for the people"" while they still seek to steal and maintain control of the country that wanted them gone. They stole billions of dollars of the country's wealth from the people, and then she goes around acting sad that parts of the country are so poor ""now,"" as if she weren't directly responsible for it.And, just like the hateful magats in America, they've convinced people that they're what's best. That fascism and stolen wealth is what's best. That murdering your opponents and ignoring the people is what's best.There's a point early in the documentary where Imelda talks about her political contemporaries. She says a lot of people called them monsters, but she didn't think they were monsters. Lady, that makes you one of the monsters.

The 2022 elections felt like a fever dream, marked by a disorienting mix of nostalgia and revisionism.

Surely the mountains of crimes she has been complicit in, families destroyed, and lives lost should not get to be overshadowed by her lies and corruption, as it has for many decades.

dannela,8,"I generally try to approach documentaries with some degree of neutrality. But how can you do that with Imelda Marcos? In her introduction, she seems like a silly, unassuming old lady sitting in her gilded home and her many shoes, handing out pesos to street children with an air of supreme disinterest. Lauren Greenfield paints a complex portrait, peeling back the layers to reveal a dangerous, intelligent and manipulative figure. Greenfield and her editor keep the film's pulse steady, combatting each of Imelda's increasingly ridiculous lies with evidence to the contrary without feeling sequential. I couldn't believe my ears when she said that martial law was the best time for human rights. I found it difficult to watch. Maybe that's because of my personal histories. Watching Ferdinand Marcos' body be interred at Libingan ng mga Bayani, where my grandfather is buried, left a pit in my stomach. Hearing the testimonies of anti-Marcos activists was devastating. And knowing that I have relatives, including my mother, who remain vocal loyalists and direct victims of the disinformation and whitewashing campaigns that are at the center of this film was another gut punch.The film was completed in 2019 and leaves off on Leni Robredo's victory over BBM in the VP election. It seems that democracy prevailed, and presents like a cautionary tale of the Marcoses; of what can be done when political dynasties are left unchecked with power and influence. As if Greenfield is wagging her finger saying, ""don't do what the Filipinos did!"" But listening to BBM ramble about stolen elections a full four years before Trump sent a chill down my spine. The propaganda and historical revisionism. The cult of personality. The militarization of the police.

The film was captivating, concerning, and strange, but it's also more curious to watch in 2023, after the Marcos family resumed control of the Filipino government last year (via son Bongbong, who appears here)... So much feels telegraphed in hindsight when they get to talking about Bongbong and his then-Vice President campaign... I have no idea if this film gained exposure over there or not, and it looks like the Marcoses had traction there regardless, but I can't help but wonder if putting this lady and her family back in the limelight didn't help gain some eyes, in spite of the film's potential intent. I know it's a different political sphere and culture (though, naturally the US is linked to all of this), but I feel the same way about the exposure of eccentrics like Tr*mp, who never would have made it into office if the media didn't constantly stick a camera on them wondering ""What kooky thing will they say next??"" with total disregard to the fact that a large sum of people will not grasp the irony and fully agree with otherwise outlandish and dangerous views.

Her story, so important to the modern political reality in the Philippines, was so carefully told to cover both the past and the present and how intricately wound they are. Brilliant to interweave the horrors of martial law in the 1970s with the rise of Bongbong (who really comes across as a doltish, boyish, puppet version of his dad) and Duterte (...yuck).The Philippines has suffered from such rampant corruption with essentially only the Aquinos offering a brief respite during the presidencies of Cory and Noynoy (the latter of which is featured in this documentary and is quite an eloquent dude).

ronaldray,9,"As a social studies teacher, I help students sharpen their critical thinking skills by presenting them facts and figures to guide them in forming their own conclusions. I don't infiltrate to them my own viewpoints, for it may influence their own views. I want my students to form their own opinions and make sure that they are based on facts and empirical evidence. This is exactly how Lauren Greenfield's The Kingmaker presented one of history's most divisive topic. It is a documentary where you see the camera roll and witness the actions speak for themselves. There is no narration, no reenactments, no script, and no talking heads. The main subjects themselves, the Marcos Family (mostly Imelda Marcos) are the ones narrating the entire story. The camera is basically a fly on the wall. Real footages and records from the exact events are also shown. I've also read that the intended direction of the film depends on how interviews went. This means the film does not intentionally gear towards one side of the story only, as both the Marcoses side, the victims, and the witnesses were evenly presented. The result? A compelling story of a true event that almost feels like fiction due to its shocking and unbelievable accounts. It makes you wonder why the Marcoses agree to be the subject of this documentary and how they feel about this.This educational documentary might be a hard watch for some, and I highly advice that the best way to watch this is to have an open mind, without any pre-conceived notions about what the show is about.

Bongbong’s life story is very typical of that movie of an almost-neglected middle child of a busy, powerful, and rich parents always in his earnest to make them proud and has since poised himself to never disappoint his parents whom he craves one thing and one thing only: parental love3. Bongbong would make a better politician than Imee4. Another Marcos cannot be allowed to hold the presidential seat5. The Filipinos people lack better judgment; they need to be educated more of the atrocities of the Marcos regime6. Imelda has a hold of those ill-gotten wealth and she’s just waiting for any of her children to be in the presidential seat so she can use them those money to redeem her family’s name7.

Apparently some Marcos apologists enjoyed this movie because of that. Still, I can sort of see the value of this work as an educational resource for the perspective of a foreigner wishing to know more about the history of this corrupt, kleptocratic family. As a Filipino however, the way the documentary presents itself just rubs me the wrong way.

keitzu,,"Watching the documentary, I am simply in disbelief that the side of the Marcos family here was supposed to be painted as if they were actually something good that happened to the Philippines. When in fact, watching this whole documentary, I just learned even more about the atrocious things they have done and thus have manifested even greater anger towards their name and family—naïvely thinking that I already knew enough about their history and was also already angry enough back then. I have to say though that the documentary shows more than simply just the story of the Marcos family and their history. After watching it, I now have realized for sure as well that the Filipino people are too forgiving, too forgetful, and too naïve. And to back that statement up, with no better proof to be given, other than that their family has already been back in power with another Marcos being the president for more than a year now as of the writing of this review. Which is all just really sad to think about—that this is the reality we're living with right now as Filipinos.It was certainly all kinds of emotions that I have felt watching this documentary. With some of it being that of utter disgust towards the Marcos family, our politics, and overall just feeling really bad for our fellow Filipinos. We truly did not deserve any of this or do we deserve yet another Marcos being back in power for that matter. The Marcos family are not even good nor wise politicians in the first place, for they did and were doing much of the atrocious stuff in broad daylight. They were just lucky they were able to prey on the fragility of the Filipino people when it comes to being politically aware. Which is yet another lengthy and very nuanced topic that deserves its separate discussion if I wanted to give it proper justice. But welp, that's the simple gist of it. The Filipino people are naïve, and that naïvety of ours is so easily preyed upon by these people in power. I can only wish and hope that we'll soon know better as a country and as the citizens of it.Anyhow, I do think that this documentary is a must watch, for better or for worse especially for us Filipinos. Just be sure to watch it with an open mind, because you are sure to be taken for quite the ride throughout, and maybe after it—you'll come out with newfound insights regarding this very important and especially relevant point of history in our country.Imelda Marcos said at one point in the documentary that, ""Perception is real, and the truth is not"" but I will argue that no matter how our perception wants to change the truth, or perceive that something is the truth instead of the other—that the truth of this controversial point of our history and the truth of the revolting history of their family—will continue to exist despite efforts of trying to perceive them the other way to bring upon a new narrative.

byrningdown,8,"I understand why some people are morally opposed to Imelda being documented like this. However, I think it clearly shows how she and Ferdinand were able to gain and keep control in the Philippines before martial law and ward off opposition during it, besides just the killing (which is very bad). It also is important because clearly, people bought into her mirage again when Bongbong was elected.

The legacy of the Marcos family is one of plunder and terror, charity (or ""projects"" as Imelda calls it) is merely a tool of reputation laundering. That shows clearly in this film. Imelda Marcos is a narcissistic thieving tyrant who probably should not have been given a nearly unfettered platform in this film. She desperately wants to be seen as a benevolent dowager, the ""Mother of the Country,"" but she is nothing but a ruthless political animal. Imelda's positioning of herself as a Mother of the Country figure is grotesque. ""This government is soulless,"" she laments after robotically handing out money to sick children. (I rewound multiple times to try and see if she actually touched any of the downtrodden or if they exist as just mere props for her.) She is, of course, speaking during the Presidency of Benigno Aquino III: son of former President Cory Aquino and Senator Ninoy Aquinowho's assassination triggered the, first, downfall of the Marcos family. It's bizarre, infruriating even, to watch this in 2023 knowing that the Marcos family has returned to power following her son's election.

dylanmatthews,,"The bet of this movie is that giving extensive space for Imelda and Bong Bong to tell their whitewashed version of Filipino history is worth it, if paired with counterpoints from the likes of Noynoy Aquino, Etta Rosales, May Rodriguez, archival footage of Cory and Ninoy, etc. Surely people will watch to the end to hear about the Marcos regime declaring martial law, their various torture methods against dissidents, their rapes of female prisoners, etc. Then Imelda will just look like a ridiculous liar, surely.It brings to mind Truffaut's observation that it's impossible to make a truly antiwar film, because any depiction of war will out of dramatic necessity make war seem compelling. Imelda is a next-level entertaining fabulist and even when she's showing you her Michelangelo and Picasso paintings, which were extremely obviously bought with stolen money, it's hard for her not to suck you in, at least a little bit.You still hear her idealized tales of Ferdinand; you still see her handing out pesos to poor street children. You tell yourself, ""I'm smart enough not to be taken in by this,"" but here we are four years after this film's release, and Bong Bong is president.The choices of what to emphasize from Marcos's crimes are odd. Who gives a shit that he had an ill-advised zebra park? During Marcos's presidency, wages in Manila fell by more than half. The fact that he led the nation to economic ruin and worsened poverty is at most glanced at, not emphasized.I get the logic. I spent the Trump years focusing on the objectively ridiculous and funny aspects of his tenure (the hamburger feast, putting candy on the minion's head) because it was a way to cope.

clevergurl,,"A stupid doc that I only realised fairly early on that its tone isn't sarcastic. Director Lauren Greenfield genuinely thinks that Imelda Marcos deserves a voice within the oh so rational and objective genre of ""the documentary"" and her position as a this neutral ""white outsider"" looking in. It's a morally dishonest, ahistorical, and pretentious position to take, for one. And second, say what you want about Imelda: shallow, facetious, a victim of those pesky ""subversives"" if you must. It doesn't take a genius to know the crock of bullshit she spouts and the surface level ""ironic"" stance this doc takes by conducting its interviews within the comforts of Imelda's home decked out with stolen riches as she fellates her husband's legacy from the grave, even more so having the movie frame itself within close proximity to her and her daily PR errands as if we're getting an ""inside look"" in the machinations of this elusive first lady. The worst part is Lauren wants to have it both ways: treat Imelda's excuses and regaling of her childhood as worth your pathos in the same breath as its cheap, emotionally exploitative interviews of victims of the Marcos regime.It's the fucking music...The music cues reveal how this film slimily switches sides and manipulates one's lack of knowledge on the history of Imelda and her legacy. The score is triumphant and optimistic as Imelda describes meeting Ferdinand and their path towards political domination. Wow, so inspirational. Uh oh, looks like Ferdinand is having an affair with actor Dovie Beams, gotta play some suspenseful high strings to really show how Imelda really was hurt by his infidelity.Oh my goodness?! Bongbong is cultivated by his mother to become the next heir of his God-given right to rule the Philippines? Alexa, play some royalty free inspirational music once again.And then at some point, Lauren realises how venerating this is all becoming, so she hard cuts to villagers from Calauit where Imelda's put her safari animals shipped directly from Africa in an attempt to spice up the 'beauty' of the Philippines. There's no music playing, so you know this is serious. Lauren strategically places these scenes proceeding Imelda to merely offset the guilt and extravagance you've been shown previously and ""expose"" how much of an oblivious person Imelda is and you are for almost believing in her. It's patronising at best, and borderline manipulative in eliciting your pitiful gasps at worst.I have no problems with interviewing victims of dictatorial regimes, but how does Lauren have the gall to face these victims with a clean conscience when earlier in the film we see her chillin beside Imelda giving out money like candy to the oh so poor and oppressed people the regime claims they didn't oppress by a literal freeway inside a moving vehicle? How does filming Imelda doing piss poor ""philanthropy"" in the present like she's always done benefit anyone? You had access to literal archival footage clearly demonstrating her shady nefariousness on live Philippine television. What point are you trying belabour to your audience besides giving Imelda free media exposure to perpetuate the same old lies she's been repeating for more than half a century? What makes you immune from the consequences of your privilege as a director where you can shift between sympathy for Imelda and empathy for her victims? This is such disgusting moral complicity utilising a veneer of ""poor people footage"" to add a bit of false progressivism for stating a completely obvious fact of what happens when you fuck over a country resulting in poverty.A useless documentary catered towards gullible international western audiences who know zilch about Filipino politics and history made by a grossly ignorant and privileged filmmaker (Harvard graduate my ass) that desperately needs a crash course on Philippine cinema history to be making such flash in the pan, juvenile bad vs good garbage.This shit ain't new to us, so don't treat our history like a Vice article.",2022-11-10,0,0,watch,False

phielipino,7,"watched at the malaya film screening at the beacon cinema. TLDR still learned/refreshed a lot after this viewing and think its still agitating, and a good entry point for learning some concrete examples of the marcos corruptioni think now that i’ve seen this a few times i can articulate how this film falls into the trap of liberal political documentaries, caricaturing political figures to the point they almost seem silly in their delusion and out of touchness. caricaturing imelda to be a super villain motherboss girlboss can be funny in a ridiculous way, exposing her frivolity and extravagance. i think this gets somewhat into how conniving and strategic she is but in some of the takeaways from this screening, i wonder if its overshadowed by the persona. it seems that her “perception is real and the truth is fake” line is taken as a sign of delusion and not a look into her and the marcoses strategy to rebrand themselves. this is not a foolish silly old woman, this is a conniving fascist who does whatever it takes to cling to her wealth and the perception of her class, even if it means feigning forgetfulness or outright lying. someone said that the delusion is mental illness and i would argue that its a media strategy from a woman who has been in the spotlight for 70+ years…reminds me of how liberals would psychoanalyze donald trump and call him a dumb cheeto instead of getting into how hes a fascist because of his political opinions and decisions. identity politics is the worst thing to come out of liberal media representation politics discoursei feel that the marcoses and other bureaucrat capitalists are given as much (if not more) time onscreen compared to the everyday people who were interviewed, so there isn’t much insight into the impacts of the political corruption on the lives of the people of the philippines. getting into villainization of just the marcos family, and to some extent rodrigo duterte himself often lacks the critique on a systemic level and sets them apart as the few bad apples when its the whole system that’s corrupt! what did cory and ninoy aquino really do for the people? i don’t think it showed what they did other than interviewing them to critique the marcosesshow us more about the power of the people! this would be a good double feature with a rustling of leaves. the power of the people that threatens the very security of the bureaucrat capitalist system!

This lady plays innocent and ignorant of the crimes of the husband or the odd assassination of their political enemies. She is so politically smart, yet so dumb or uncaring that she removed the inhabitants of an island for African wildlife to run free with no care or insight into how suitable the animals were or could survive and be cared for decades. She performs magic by managing to flaunt her stolen wealth, cry poor and then hide her billions from the authorities. The real insight is seeing how power can be bought, as the Marcos buy their way back into power by bankrolling a ruthless, sexist, murderous autocrat into the presidency. Who then paves the way for the family’s return, removing their enemies and opening the door wide open for them. No doubt Trump and his sons will use the same technique.

What's so frightening is this revisionist history that the Marcos political machinery has careful cultivated and paid for the delusion of Filipinos, both in the homeland and the diaspora. The scene in the school where the kids are saying that martial law was a good and prosperous time for the Philippines is terrifying. For all of the Philippines' obsession with history – with Rizal, Bonifacio, Aquino – that history is being rewritten in real time, through social media, through public speeches, through lies. And this film just shows the brazenness of it all. Behind the ""motherly"" facade and the openly giving out of money, all that Imelda Marcos wants is power for her family and is willing to do whatever it takes.What a film.

a_ctually,10,"You cannot talk about Ferdinand Marcos’ dictatorship without talking about his wife. American director Lauren Greenfield not only paints a pretty complete picture of Imelda Marcos and her influence but also lays the ground for the future of Philippine politics.It was important that this documentary was an American production because the Marcoses would never have openly bared their stolen wealth to Philippine media. Greenfield and her team had access to one-on-one interviews with the late dictator’s family and their ostentatious households. But with every memory Imelda recalls, and every art piece she shows off, Greenfield counters them with testimonials from Martial Law activists and victims. This results in exposing the delusion the Marcoses live in.The documentary also chose Calauit Island to represent the Marcoses’ effect on the country. The regime initiated many costly projects, but Calauit Island was a fever dream. Indeed, Imelda dreamt of beautifying the country with poached animals from Africa at the cost of the natives of Calauit Island. Today, the island is long forgotten but the animals remain and are neglected. Similarly, the dictatorship had left the country in shambles, with mounds of debt and a fractured political infrastructure.The Kingmaker isn’t just a retelling of the past. The latter half of the film follows Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s bid for the vice presidency in the 2016 elections. While he narrowly lost, a new dictator stepped in and echoed the crimes of his father. Here, Greenfield concludes the film with a warning of history repeating. Looking back, and considering Marcos Jr.’s recent win in the 2022 presidential elections, The Kingmaker is an excellent explanation for how and why we got here.Subscribe to Actually/Certainly’s Newsletter“Media content you should and shouldn’t waste your time on”",2022-07-22T15:57:10.687Z,3,0,watch,True

ardio,8,"""Perception is real, and the truth is not.""One of the first images that come to mind when watching this film is simply of an old woman, clad in Filipino dress, in a gilded room, adorned with paintings by Picasso and Monet, with golden idols strewn across the tables and in a room that harkens back to kings and queens of old, as she tells her story about how bad she had it. It's a lie, of course, as most things that the Marcos family has, have and will say, but it's a lie people believe. Imelda Marcos understands the power the media has, the way she contorts and changes her words to fit the narrative she wants us to believe, but the editing doesn't allow her words to come out unscathed, juxtaposing her picturesque words with words and footage of torture, punishment and other such catastrophes that could make even the most sympathetic follower squirm. But it's not enough.Of course, it's easy to say that putting her in front of the camera is a good or bad idea, but we often forget that words don't exist on their own in film, they come from the interaction between shots, and even the relationship between footage and audio, and placing neutrality and restraint against an obviously inhumane person is immoral. Covering someone like Imelda Marcos, a person who has almost complete control and understanding over her image is tricky to make well, especially as an outsider like Greenfield, but if you want to cover Marcos, and all of their infamy, especially the person who essentially serves, and still does, as right hand man of her family, you have to be unrelenting and unflinching. As the Philippines evolves, technology moves forward, and the way we consume and the way we determine what is just and true gets harder everyday. It is imperative we are aware of this as our history becomes rewritten, crimes of the past become null and dynasties rise back to power. We have to be aware of these things, these ideas that media can be manipulated and used as propaganda, as agents of control because all media exists that way.Triumph of the Will, a 1935 film depicting Hitler and his Third Reich, is notorious for shaping the way we view the Nazi Party, less as an army breaking apart at the seams as they slaughtered one another due to paranoia, and more of an unrelenting force set out to destroy all we know and love. This disconnect from reality and fiction led to our newfound perception of these people, and it is happening to us.By simply giving these people a platform, by giving them full reign on how they are covered, how they are broadcast nationally, we are giving them the power to manipulate, and it is happening all over, as seen within the film. That's why, when we come to critique this family, we have to take them swiftly and dangerously, not leaving shallow cuts, but scathing stab wounds. Ferdinand Marcos is not a hero, he was a fascist. Plain and simple. He embezzled government funds, he tortured, killed and violated his people and he left wounds we are still covering from, and this revisionist history we have now, the way even the lower classes, who were hit hardest, still believe that crimes are to be ignored in favor of worshipping a past that never existed is something to be concerned about.These crimes were never reconciled with, they have no closure and they are still open to this very day. The animals Imelda Marcos released upon Calauit are still hanging there, the stolen jewelry she has is still not returned, and the system that these people manipulated and used is still not fixed, as seen by the blood on our streets and cries in the middle of the night, with politicians who believe that blood of the poor spilled by corrupt cops is valid.The people have every right to be angry, but we should be critical and understand our history, especially after the current context of the son of the late dictator, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., bearing the name of his father, has won the election, along with Rodrigo Duterte's daughter, who has killed people in the name of his ""drug war."" We have a history of revolutions, some won and some lost, and the fight for liberty doesn't stop when someone wins or loses. It is won through continued and watchful progress, through knowledge and the acknowledgement of the past and through wisdom to see through the lies. Anger is in our blood, use it wisely.",2022-05-14,2,0,watch,True

mediapundit,8,"The Kingmaker is the story of ruthless and narcissistic Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, and her family’s attempts to work their way back into power after her husband’s overthrow.Imelda was the wife of the corrupt Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the country between 1965-1986. In interviews she comes across as caring, generous, and eccentric, but the documentary reveals the more sinister aspects of her and her husband's rule; in particular the theft of billions from the country and a period of brutal dictatorship involving torture, rape and murder.During martial law in the Philippines over 3,000 people were killed and 70,000 imprisoned, some for as little as being at a meeting with five or more people. Activists appear in the film with chilling stories of being tortured and sexually assaulted under the Marcos regime. The reign of terror lasted until Ferdinand was overthrown after trying to rig an election in 1986, ushering in democracy in the country over the protests of some of America’s Cold War hawks.It’s never clear how involved Imelda was in the worst acts of her husband’s government, although there are hints in the film that she helped to mastermind the assassination of an opposition leader. It is obvious that she benefitted from the record-breaking corruption of the Marcos regime; as a result her habit of handing out wads of money to the poor takes on a sinister air.If there is one word to sum up Imelda, it is narcissistic. Throughout the documentary her hunger for popularity goes beyond all reason; she sees nothing wrong with importing giraffes and zebras into a country where there are no vets to take care of them, leaving them suffering from skin diseases. At one point, she seemingly sincerely says that Chairman Mao told her that she could end the Cold War.Her accumulation of wealth goes beyond practical levels and seems compulsive; her family looted a literally record-breaking amount of money and helped to impoverish The Philippines for decades, and on a more petty level she was famous for having a collection of over 3,000 shoes. You could say that Imelda is similar to Trump, or alternatively, that Trump resembles any number of self-deluded dictators throughout history, who tend to be self-obsessed in the worst way.Such characters have an enduring appeal despite their ridiculousness, and as many people in the documentary note, the Philippines has been forgiving to strongmen in the past. With Rodrigo Duterte's brutal rule coming to an end and Imelda's son Bongbong Marcos in power in the Philippines as of May 2022, the country may unfortunately be on a path to repeating its previous mistakes.",2022-05-09,38,0,watch,False

Leni was our chance at making the country great again with CLEAN, GOOD AND TRANSPARENT GOVERNANCE but what have we done. the egos of my own fellow countrymen, they turn a blind eye and continue to defend thieves. it hurts that they will only realize what they've done when marcoses are already back in power.

gluesong,,"Fuck the Marcoses. I hope they will all rot in hell.I cried yesterday after seeing Marcos Jr. leading the unofficial tallying of votes. This is a serious call for a nationwide educational crisis and the need to eradicate disinformation and misinformation circulating in social media platforms, because it is all in the favor of the Marcoses. But how can we protect students—ourselves—from miseducation if the incumbent and the newly elected are the ones benefiting the most from this unjust system?Miss Jessica Soho was right when she said that the politics that we have right now in the Philippines seems to perpetuate poverty.My heart goes to all the victims under the administrations of Marcos and Duterte.
