firstshowing,8,"""Perception is real, the truth is not."" Lauren Greenfield's elegantly crafted doc about the political dynasty in the Philippines. Another maddening look at how those with wealth and power will never give it up, coming up with new ways to maintain their dominant command of power. One of these films that just makes me so angry about how much wealth rules the world and how they manipulate the masses so much (to be in their favor). And keep getting away with it. I like the way this doc is put together, it has a more compelling narrative than her last film Generation Wealth, but is just as fascinating to watch.",2019-08-29,22,0,watch,True

darrencb,7,"""Perception is real, and the truth is not"". These terrifying words come from the delusional Imelda Marcos, whose influence on politics in the Philippines is scary. The Kingmaker interviews Marcos at length, only for it to become clear that she is a greedy liar seeking to play the victim. Her opulent lifestyle and desire to birth a paradise is slowly realised to come from a scary place. As The Kingmaker is mostly a conventional documentary, aside from its lack of chronology, it feels likely to become a neoliberal piece of mild condemnation without the guts to pick apart Filipino politics. Yet The Kingmaker does find a voice, and manages to find fault in the more liberal governments in the Philippines. Their inability to solve the problems are shown by the film's eventual focus on the resurgence of the Marcos family and their proxy candidate, the evil Rodrigo Duterte. It is a sad and scary time for the Philippines and really this story is still breaking. Who knows if The Kingmaker is telling this slice of history at its beginning or end.There's horrifying moments in The Kingmaker, such as the chilling accounts of torture, the children who openly like martial law, and the fact that Rodrigo Duterte has any power. As a documentary this may not be very inspired, but the subject matter is vital for us all to know. The inbreeding nature of politics has allowed one family to have influence, either overtly or covertly, over an entire country for decades. Perhaps Imelda Marcos does have a plan for paradise, but is the path to it justifiable?2019 Ranked",2019-10-06,116,1,watch,False

smiffl,8,"*followed by a Q&A featuring Director Lauren Greenfield*Imelda Marcos isn’t someone I was familiar with at all prior to this documentary but it didn’t take much to see how she is a prime candidate for a film. Her personality is eye catching and confusing while also being headstrong and assertive. The Q&A that took place following the screening helped improved my view of the film as some of the director’s choices made more scene after hearing how they came to be. One issue I had/have is the level of focus early on on Imelda’s bring of animals to an island and running off its prior inhabitants. While this is an interesting and quirky story, it is later followed up with the film’s first deep dive into the era of Marshall Law in the Philippines brought on by her late husband Ferdinand Marcos. This is far more interesting and far more important to the narrative than this island full of giraffes and I had issues with the time allotment of the two, as well as how much of the earlier portion of the doc feels far too casual given the level of information that is conveyed in the later half. While still is problematic for me, it helped to hear that over the process of filming this movie, much of the later events weren’t even in play yet. So at the time the film felt like it was going to be one thing before new storylines emerged. It doesn’t completely remove my issues about it but it make more sense and for me makes it more understandable a choice. It is a documentary worthy of keeping an eye out for as I think much of it will be a welcomed source of information for most about the political issues in the Philippines and how people like Imelda can be so influential to even if from a distance she looks like a comical character of sorts.",2019-10-18,2,0,watch,True
reservedseating,6,To a person who only knows the history of the Marcos dynasty from the Wikipedia article this was appropriately terrifying and illuminating. There are some major issues with the film itself; I can't be sure but it feels like Laura Greenfield went in expecting to just do a bio/exposé on Imelda but then got ensnared in the insanity of 2016 national election. The movie struggles with mission creep; the last 30 minutes depicting the results of that surprising election unfold at breakneck speeds that barely hang together and then at the end require a long series of title cards. It feels tacked-on but I'm not sure that there was any other way to convey the insane turn the story was taking.,2019-10-19,2,0,watch,True

rramos1032,10,"Lauren Greenfield (""The Queen of Versailles,"" ""Generation Wealth"") has once again proven why she's my favorite documentary filmmaker, and one of my favorite filmmakers, period. She explores new territory in ""The Kingmaker,"" without straying away from her signature ""photographic"" and intimate style; the DNA of her style is felt and serves as a backbone to new elements that elevate it to another level in order to successfully cover the story of Imelda Marcos and politics in The Philippines. Everything I admire about her body of work is present on this one: Metaphors of excess and unbalance and its consequences; glamour and its beauty, but also how comical it can be; the obsession with material things and its demons. However, due to the nature of the subject, it goes a step further, diving into political territory and giving us a cautionary tale about power and greed that is harsh, timely, but hopeful. This project might not have been the culmination of 25 years of work like ""Generation Wealth,"" but it's probably the most challenging one Greenfield has had to make. The challenges of this five-year endeavor are seen and felt on the screen, but they pay off. If Greenfield and her team were able to accomplish this, then I cannot wait to see what's next in store.I highly recommend this documentary: A portrait of a woman in and out of power; of a country in and out of justice; of a political system in and out of the past.

nicolatte_love,6,"Low 3.Got to go to a special screening followed by a conversation with Director Lauren Greenfield. I sadly have not seen any of her previous work. I also had no idea what this was about. I seriously hate movies like this because it reminds me just how little I know of the world. 😂😂 I knew nothing about Marcos. Don't know anything about the Philippines even. 😬As I've said before Documentaries aren't my go to genre but I will always be grateful they exist because I love learning about things I never knew about. Pretty crazy all the stuff that was shown here.But I found this to be pretty confusing. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel for Imelda Marcos at first. I just mean the way the story was laid out. The audience reaction to certain things was different to mine as well which added to my confusion. Then for me I'm not even sure how people in the Philippines feel about Imelda Marcos? At one point it seems like everyone hates her but then it seems like people now love her? I guess I would have like interviews from people explaining why they love her. I guess it's just something I'll have to look into myself. I don't know for me I just didn't really like the way this was laid out. It painted her as a great lady then out of no where we were supposed to hate this family then they would explain why. I think I would have liked a more linear storyline. BUT during the conversation she did actually speak to that. She said when doing a documentary the audience believes what they are seeing. So what do you do when you have a subject that lies? So I guess that explains the storyline feeling all over the place for me because she would cut to actual facts after Imelda Marcos said something that wasn't true. So that does make sense but it just really had a way of feeling disjointed for me. Also there was a part where they were interviewing someone about something really dark and personal and before they finished talking cut to another interview about the same topic and that really threw me. So it was two people talking about something similar at the same time. I didn't like that I would have preferred to hear one at a time especially about something so sad. But yeah I guess I would have just liked things better explained. I feel as someone who knows nothing about what went down I would have liked to know more about when Martial Law happened and about how they were accused of stealing millions. I just feel like things weren't explained as good as I would have liked. Felt like it just touched the surface. This would focus on different things all at once and like I said just felt all over the place for me. But it was still good and learned a lot. Pretty shocking all that happened and what all is still going on. And seriously Animal Island broke my heart. I'd say check this out if you can, I believe it will be on Showtime. You may enjoy this more than I did and if anything the interviews and the access Greenfield had to Imelda Marcos is very impressive.",2019-10-23,7,0,watch,False

She's a modern-day Rasputin, who can hypnotize people and place them under her spell. Perhaps it is not the filmmaker's intention that when we do not hear from Imelda for a stretch of time, the movie slows down to a halt.In those long stretches, we yearn for more Imelda on screen. Like the Philippines, we are smitten from the first minute to the last.

cinephile_ken,7,"""The Kingmaker"" begins as an unfettered check-in on the life of one of the 20th century's most notorious figures, Imelda Marcos. Like a visit to the zoo, we're granted the opportunity to observe the seemingly self-delusional Marcos in her current habitat as she dreams of a time and place she no longer occupies. Filmmaker Lauren Greenfield allows Imelda the chance to justify, in her own words, her and her late husband's ruthless and corrupt reign as the authoritarian overlords of the Philippines. Greenfield doesn't assist Imelda in her efforts to rewrite history, but she allows Imelda to state her case even as the film mixes in interviews from former friends and enemies (and victims). There are even moments of humor during the film's early-going, as Imelda's obliviousness to the audience's feeling of disgust toward her wastefully lavish and cartoonish lifestyle, cruel indifference for the rights of her fellow countrymen, and insistence on innocence lands perfectly as a joke at the former Filipino First Lady's expense.However, the film transforms into something far uglier and more frightening as Greenfield transitions from mere case study to political exposé (albeit, one that could be a bit more focused). Like watching a horror film, ""The Kingmaker"" turns the joke around on the Filipino people and the audience. Laugh as you might at Imelda and her seemingly fantastical defenses of the Marcos regime and her pipe dream of seeing her son, BongBong, someday elevated to the presidency, the terrifying and telling reality is that Imelda has not yet been relegated to 20th century has-been. At nearly 90, she's a member of the Filipino House of Representatives, the mother of an influential Filipino senator (her daughter) and a very possible future president (her son), and a behind-the-scenes benefactor of the current authoritarian-leaning president, Rodrigo Dutarte. Delusional though she may be, Imelda is still as cunningly manipulative as ever. Hell, she may be once again controlling the strings of power in the Philippines, more than 30 years after she and her husband were forced into exile. It's the kind of film that sends a chill down your back as the credits roll.",2019-11-20,3,0,watch,False

It was a case filled with fraud and speculation on how this couple was making their money yet a lack of solid evidence to support that whatever it was they were doing was unjust. Today, the concern is that Imelda's son, Bongbong is on his way to ruling the Philippines which terrifies many since history is seemingly beginning to repeat itself in the sense that whoever speaks out negatively about the family suddenly disappears or is subject to assassination with a cover up. I just find this so insane and I feel the best thing to do is to spread the word. It's such a controversial case and Lauren Greenfield did an excellent job at showing both perspectives.

kano,8,"Beneath the thick make-up and perfected smile of Imelda Marcos there seems to be something more sinister and unnerving about her appearance. “Perception is real and truth is not,” she says when speaking about accusations of torture and abuse of power, and it's this understanding of how to manipulate her image that has enabled her to remain outside of a prison cell for so long. It’s a warped form of cognitive dissonance that director Lauren Greenfield has captured in her documentary, The Kingmaker, showing the rise, fall and steady rise again of the Marcos clan in the Philippines.Greenfield has spent much of her career documenting the rich and deluded, which made Marcos the perfect subject. She is famous for her lavish lifestyle which included the ownership of thousands of luxury brand shoes and the spending over $2 billion of state money during her time in power. But the longer Greenfield spent with Imelda, the more obvious it became she was an unreliable narrator, locked away in a fantasy bubble refusing to face up to the pain her family has caused the Philippine people for the past half century.Imelda dominates the first half of the film speaking about her journey to government alongside former husband, and now deceased President, Ferdinand Marcos. At the same time she is galvanising support behind her son, Bongbong, while he seeks election as Vice President. Greenfield managed to secure good access to the former First Lady with a one-on-one interview at home, also following her as she travels through the Manila slums (“it never used to be like this” she says with faux incredulity) handing out cash from the huge wad fixed to her side. She makes a good fist of playing the ‘woman of the people’ role, but it is little more than a sham.Review continues over at The Digital Fix",2019-11-07,12,0,watch,True

ewan_m,7,"Lauren Greenfield has made films about people with immense wealth before, and both those and her books tend to cover that uncomfortable collision of aspirational wealth and real lived experiences, about little corners of the human psyche (or rather bigger ones in some cases) that desire the glossy fashion spread lifestyle. Imelda Marcos largely fits neatly into that, but with a far bigger and more dangerous political footprint that continues to make itself felt. Ostensibly the title is about her relationship with her husband, the massively corrupt dictator of the Philippines for two decades from the mid-60s to the mid-80s (at which point he was ousted by a 'People Power' revolution via the wife of an assassinated opposition leader, Corazon Aquino), whose power she was said to manipulate for her own ends, most famously for the acquisition of art, designer items and of course shoes. But the film moves quickly on from these trappings to her real and lingering effect on Filipino politics, via her family's dynasty and their support for current dictator-wannabe Rodrigo Duterte. Stylistically it frames Marcos with the opulence of her living spaces, repeatedly showing her handing out money to her loyal supporters crowding around her car or in public appearances (often held and distributed by her staff). She shows off art and photos of her with world leaders (at one point hilariously, but utterly unconcernedly, breaking some of these framed highlights while reaching to show off one, I think with her and Nixon). She is also apparently blithely unaware of how her namedropping comes across, especially when she's talking about aforementioned world leaders or her art collection. She could be a figure of fun, but gradually the film becomes more and more serious about her impact, as it layers on the Marcos's crimes and the real effects of the policies and division they have sowed within the society, paving the way for her and her family's chilling return to power.",2019-12-13,0,0,watch,True

doofood,7,"Really brilliantly constructed - the film sets up as a cosy, cute, harmless portrait of an eccentric celebrity in her grey years, and allows itself to remain in that framework as the body count grows higher, as Kissinger dances on the screen, as the talking heads, initially brought in to provide sappy reminiscing about Imelda's public life, begin to admit propping up dictators for the US' foreign policy interests or detail their sexual assault at the hands of the Marcos regime, as the gormless Jeb Bush-like son goes from affable mummy's boy to a brutal example of the violence of capital exerting itself, and of course as it ends with the still-unfolding nightmare of Duterte. The usefulness of this for the film is that it provides an aesthetic critique of the influence of capital on society by relating everything back to Marcos, in that we see that all its awful violence, its total control over humanity, its manufacturing of poverty and suffering, don't serve some sort of greater noble cause, but instead simply exist so that an elite can buy shoes and completely bizarre confirmations of their self-image. It's useful sometimes to remember how utterly ugly it all is, and how power has no correlation to either intelligence or beauty, it just exerts itself in service of itself - I'd never immediately disbelieve someone who told me the rich devote their whole lives to worshipping Molloch and doing satanic rituals, because there's no need for these things to be real for the idiotic rich to exploit the world in practicing them, as Marcos' obsessive world-mother fantasy and surreal safari island show. The woozy, nightmarish quality of the film's descent into horror doesn't distract from the reality, and it's a serious documentary that isn't reductive to just pointing at the absurdity of the rich. Instead, it uses these contrasts to make the total dominion of capital in public life and its attendant brutality that protects and asserts the power of the dominant elite all the more vivid, and shows how apparently laughable figures like Duterte can exist as the sinew between capitalism and fascism, artificially creating a need and then fulfilling it with a solution that has no alternative (or, a failed neoliberal alternative), like Marcos literally buying the affection of the poor she helped impoverish. It's that clear critique of capital as a structure and empathy for the oppressed throughout that keeps it from being just liberal aesthetic critique, although mockery of the venal rich still has its place - don't let unfunny US talk show hosts take it away from you completely.",2019-12-14,6,0,watch,False

sanriel,7,"I think the most important thing that The Kingmaker did was to directly connect the Marcoses to Duterte - the money, the power, the influence, the strategy, the long con - in a way that is easy for people to follow and understand. Infuriating and frustrating to watch how this same story played out twice in our lifetimes.The main takeaway is proper education. Even I don’t remember being taught about the horrors of Martial Law in elementary and high school - I remember only memorizing that Marcos was the president that stayed the longest in power. Which is useless. If not for university, I probably would be as clueless as these kids in the movie, especially with how active the Marcoses are paying people to revise history to their advantage - which as we saw, our unreliable narrator Imelda Marcos has obviously started to believe and claim as historical facts. Also, how was it possible that after EDSA Revolution and TWO Aquino presidencies that there is still no memorial or museum detailing the atrocities of Martial Law?? This is why we always forget. Germany has its Holocaust memorial, and even Cambodia has the same for the Polpot genocides. How do we not have any? Why do we go to theme parks for field trips instead of a Martial Law museum? Sad thing is, it’s too late now. Not going to happen with the current government, after what we’ve seen in The Kingmaker. It is a testament to Greenfield’s dedication and craft that she was able to cover 50 years of Philippine history and show it in a very comprehensive and compelling structure, and managed to connect what has happened in the 70s to what is happening today by following the thread of money and power.",2020-01-29,21,0,watch,False

quark,7,"Lauren Greenfield has always had this strange fascination with showing how wealth corrupts people and how excess magnifies eccentricity. I went to an exhibit of hers sometime last year and found it interesting how so many of the portraits were of Imelda Marcos. Imagine my excitement, then, when I found out that the reason behind that was that Greenfield was making a documentary about Imelda. Finally, the wider world would know about the regime that tore our country into pieces. The Kingmaker is mostly successful at that, but it hardly treads new ground. She is portrayed in the documentary like she is portrayed in other international cultural works that feature her: eccentric, charismatic, having led a charmed life, having possessed 3000 shoes. In the end you have to wonder if it's Greenfield who's ""tricking"" Imelda into making this doc, or it's Imelda who's playing Greenfield.Strangely enough, the section that made it most interesting for me is what probably made it a weaker documentary. There is a 30 minute digression where we hardly see Imelda, and instead focus on the 2016 Vice Presidential elections. The family sees it as a chance to regain power and redeem their name, but their delusions of grandeur and desperation are only magnified. And while Bong Bong Marcos lost the elections, it is apparent that their power only grows stronger with the allegiance of Rodrigo Duterte. It feels less cohesive as a documentary as a result, but at least we're seeing something new. So is it good? I feel it is. Is it enough? Hardly. While there was a heartbreaking series of interviews with Martial Law victims, it is only implied that Imelda Marcos has something to do with this. Why was there no coverage of the convictions in international courts? Why was there no definite statement about the guilt of this woman? The Kingmaker is just another piece of cinema that perpetuates Imelda Marcos's legend. What I want to see is an outright condemnation of this woman, because she deserves nothing less.

hk258,8,"I've never heard so much aghast tutting in my life as from the audience at this screening. Imelda Marcos was the wife of Ferdinand Marcos, dictator of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, when she and her husband fled into exile. But in the early 1990s her family returned to the Philippines and in the 2010s began it's return to the frontline of politics, seeking office for her son Bongbong. This film, with a tone of mounting horror, relates their appallingly successful efforts to return to power, the facts as frequently jaw-dropping as they are terrifying. For 90 minutes we watch this despicable cartoon villain throw herself a pity party while others suffer the consequences of her vomit-inducing luxury. The ripest metaphor at the films centre is the safari park she and her husband built, evicting hundreds of families from their island home to make way for animals poached from Africa. The film doesn't quite sell this as a metaphor for the political inbreeding, but it remains an incisive example of the cruelty and selfishness these vile humans spread. The initial catalogue of corruption, fraud, ignorance, exploitation and negligence gradually gives way to the insidious background whispers of genuine atrocities committed, before, in the final act, the curtain is fully drawn back and the extent and immediacy of the consequences of their unquenched thirst for power are lain bare and we finally grasp how urgent and real the threat these people pose democracy truly is. It is the rising panic of witnessing the wave of populism and post-truth over the last half a decade condensed down into 90 minutes. Initial disbelief mixed with a touch of amused mocking scorn, before the prickling sense of unease and ultimate bone chilling realisation that this is our reality now and these people, the worst of humanity, utterly devoid of self-reflection, empathy, intelligence or decency, really are running the world. It's a stunningly effective, if incomplete, account of our nightmare modern reality.",2020-02-08,2,0,watch,True
cinesensual,,"The Kingmaker: Or The Court's FoolSome people say there shouldn't be any platform anymore that would let Imelda Marcos speak. Anything that seems to come out of her mouth serves no higher purpose than to arouse her narcissism as nothing she says adds any real value to what we already know.Squeezing a reasonable statement from her is futile. This documentary would've worked without her. But the thing is: if given the chance for myself, I would've let it all be and made the documentary all about her relishing in her nonsense.No seriously, let me explain. From the cartoonish first shot of Imelda giving bills to the frenzied poor, The Kingmaker had a sense of a mockumentary in it that aims to highlight Imelda's delusions. For a second, I was suspicious about the prospect of this film hellbent on being pro-Imelda propaganda. But then it went somewhere and I realized: the film is not trolling us, it is trolling the Marcos matriarch herself. And in some moments of brilliant comedy, it seems that even she is trolling herself. It looks like I am watching The Office (2005), even though I never did see an episode of The Office. Or a Taika Waititi political satire akin to What We Do In The Shadows (2014), but tyrants instead of vampires, even though I never did see What We Do In The Shadows.By then you ask, ""Is this reviewer full of himself? This is the Marcoses we are talking about for crying out loud! None of this is a laughing matter.""And so I answer, ""Comedy here is so intentional, you must have been an idiot or a hardcore Marcos fanatic to miss it.""Greenwood's editing in The Kingmaker is so deliberate in making its subject ridiculous. There are times when scenes should've ended, but then she decides to linger into awkward pauses. Some cuts evoke absurd motifs that elicit restrained laughs. Restrained because they are positioned in instances where the situation programmed you to feel something else.I sure wish the documentary went in this direction completely. Relax, it did go into serious territory. And at this point, the film starts to falter. At least in a self-deprecating mockumentary, you would have focus. Greenwood's fault is that she tried to inject a little bit of everything in the narrative of The Kingmaker hence making the documentary boggled and frustratingly on the fence. It is obviously against tyranny, of course. But then again the documentary could've been appropriated and misread as a loving portrait of the old hag by some people. Which did happen for some appalling reason.By then you ask, ""Is a mockumentary more susceptible to misinterpretation?"" And so I stubbornly answer, ""Shut up. I know. At least we had the unapologetic LOLs.""However, as an informative piece that serves as an entry-level lesson to our history, The Kingmaker is highly successful. It even shed light on lesser known controversies that Imelda managed to get her hands on - the Calauit island conversion to an African safari and displacement of its indigenuos people. But you could still accuse the documentary for being pandering to liberals. It portrays the Aquinos as eventual heroes to history, as if the Cory Aquino administration saw significant improvement in the country's atmosphere. Which it didn't, as things arguably went worse.The documentary has an oversimplified black-and-white approach to the subject it tackles that could be a disservice to the complexities of our history, a possible by-product of Greenfield being an outsider.It works for students and foreigners, the latter of which is the real audience of the film. But to people who already made up their minds, there's only so much that this film could do.In a perfect world, The Kingmaker would educate more people on the truth of our history. And it would push loyalists to be more critical of their politics. Hell, in a perfect world, there would've been no need for The Kingmaker. But this isn''t a perfect world. In all seriousness, films like these are noble efforts and should be made more often. Only people should be more critical of what they watch.In lesser seriousness, let me end by cherishing this gem of a scene from the documentary: There's a scene where Imelda recounts how she hid diamonds in diapers to be taken with her as they try to leave Malacañang due to the People Power Revolution. ""Diamonds in diapers,'' jokes Imelda. Then an awkward pause as she hopes for some laughs in the audience. No one laughed. Then I laughed because no one laughed.

The documentary starts off a bit humorous, with Imelda introducing herself and her life before. The things she tells the camera are quite funny because it makes her look delusional- her actions are mostly eye-rolling (we spend a lot of time watching her give children with banknotes). It's full of spectacle, with archival footage of her hanging out with foreign leaders like Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, and Mao Zedong. But as soon as the interviews with Martial Law survivors enters the picture, you realize that she's an unreliable narrator- the story she's been telling us was leaning towards a certain narrative aiming to cleanse our view towards her, the Marcos family, and Martial Law in general.Imelda is obviously using melodrama to get the poor's sympathy- a strategic story to support their return to power as she & her children, Bongbong & Imee, try to climb the ladder back to the government. What's worse is that they are also trying to revise our country's history, by changing what has transcribed in the past and teaching these fake information to the youth. At one point, some kids were asked what they know about Martial Law. Their answers stupefied me, with all of them saying that it was a 'golden' era for the Philippines.

It's uncomfortable and infuriating, knowing that this family who has blantantly abused this country (and still do!) is still not held responsible for their numerous crimes to the state. I find it an interesting direction choice to use Imelda as an unreliable narrator and then juxtaposing that with archival footage and firsthand testimonies of people affected by the 1972 Martial Law, which diametrically opposes what the Marcos family claims. The access Greenfield and her team had with the family is also worth noting because it's quite obvious that they're all putting a show—all part of their scheme to revise history and put themselves back into power. But we know better than that. Greenfield used that access to present something beyond the Marcoses' ""show""—families and villagers displaced from their homes because the Marcoses want their very own island zoo, thousands of victims of human rights abuses, even the people working for them that are treated like pawns instead of human beings. But it's a pity they still tried to play it safe. If you're going to give people like the mythmaker a platform, you need to be clear and firm in your stance instead of staying neutral.It's very important to process the film after watching it. People who saw this film should note that all of this isn't about the Marcos-Aquino family feud or a fight between political parties.

This is done by lessening interview footage of the Marcoses themselves and favoring the interviews that are anti-Marcos, a very simple way of switching perspective.

What's funny, I think, is that in its attempt to show the Marcoses' humanity—or lack thereof—it did not let enough voice from the masses to speak. That's why my favorite parts were when it touched on the Calauit Safari, because it puts the two classes at odds with each other (and how order both in nature and in humans was threatened because of it). Still, I think it's an important film especially for people who are learning about the family's atrocities for the first time.

They're widely believed to have illegally amassed a wealth of billions of U.S. dollars, all of which has never been recovered, holding the Guinness World Record for greatest government robbery. She has since been charged with her dealings and corruption, as well as disqualified from holding any public office. But was later cleared of all previous charges on appeal, and still continues to live in Manila.In this documentary, she's very much still living the lavish lifestyle and gladly shows everyone her priceless collection of luxuries, including paintings and sculptures.

Both Eva and Imelda, beautiful women who came from the poor and rose to power beside their dictator husband, are similarly fascinating people who wield such influence that they start to believe they were saviors or ""mothers"" of their people. Plus they have great musicals based on their lives. The interesting thing about Lauren Greenfield's ""The Kingmaker"" is how the tone of the film shifts midway. The first half of the doc shines on the past, presenting us with Imelda's many eccentricities and extravagant lifestyle that were so funny to learn about. But it then shifts into serious politics of the present where we get to learn that Imelda is still wielding power by helping to elect his son into the Vice-Presidency.

v9733xa,7,"☆""Perception is real. The truth is not.""☆It's Women's History Month. Love her or hate her, Imelda Marcos is definitely a woman who made history.In short time I'm going to work my way backwards through documentarian Lauren Greenfield's filmography, starting with her most recent film, The Kingmaker, profiling Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of The Philippines. Notable for far more than just her epic shoe collection, Marcos held the reigns of power behind-the-scenes during her family's time in office, and now has hopes to return to the presidential mansion.Greenfield's style in this film is to allow Marcos to tell her own history and her own story at first. We follow her in-person as she is interviewed, talking about her family, upbringing, and rise to power in the mid-1960s. For over two decades, her husband Ferdinand ruled with her at his side, a political power broker and key agent in diplomacy, using her striking looks and infectious charm to be as close to other world leaders -- often conservative, often dictatorial -- as her husband ever was. Famously catching Ferdinand cheating on her with tape recorder under the bed, which she used as blackmail to get what she wanted later, she grew in prestige and influence into the 80s as the family lived like extravagant royalty amidst a nation suffering in abject poverty. It was the 1986 People Power revolution (and election of Corazon Aquino) which forced them from office and exiled the family from ever ruling The Philippines again.Of course, the Marcos regime ruled with an iron fist in a military dictatorship, and gradually through The Kingmaker the stories of others -- those affected by the imposition of martial law, the families evicted from their homes to the Marcos family could build and renovate at will, the torture victims and political prisoners of innumerable amounts -- come to the fore, and the real truth is revealed about Imelda. That is, Greenfield allows her to be an unreliable narrator, and brings in members of the Aquino family and other opponents to counter her fabrications and exaggerations, like a form of fact checking. Along with her son Bongbong who Imelda wishes to see back in the presidential palace again -- and who probably likes Parasite exactly twice as much as you do -- the two craft a fantastical tale of their birthright to rule, while everyone else fights against their corruption and misdeeds as the loving Marcos clan cozies up to current sociopathic president Duterte.Now in her late 80s, Imelda appears unrepentant and even in denial of any of her family's actions. And why would she admit them? She still maintains fabulous wealth that was shipped offshore and retained after exile, still flaunting it in the face of today's Filipino people and using it to further Bongbong's campaign. In a bizarre state of denial about the years of horror her family brought to The Philippines, Imelda plays the victim and twists the facts to beg for sympathy; unfortunately it has worked in some ways, stealing billions from the country while many Filipinos suffered.Greenfield has explored themes of wealth, privilege, and bewildering ignorance of power and influence before, and The Kingmaker does that effectively. The doc plays with a linear timeline a little, and the shifting stories can make it difficult to follow if you don't already have knowledge of the era. I imagine anyone not from the Philippines and especially anyone under 30 might need more background information about this history to fully grasp the evil of the Marcos regime and impact for decades more, as well as how it's profoundly affected the current Duterte era. This film though is an excellent start.Added to The Best Documentary Films of 2019.Added to Lauren Greenfield ranked.",2020-03-13,12,0,watch,True

nalachin,10,"Imelda Marcos is delusional. I am not a PolSci student nor have the credibility to speak up properly about politics and I don't know alot about this topic so I'm glad there is a proper documentary about this. This post is very long. If u have the time to read it go ahead. I'd like to start off by saying I absolutely love the camerawork here. I love studying cinematography and hope to be a cinematographer someday and I must say that knowing this is a documentary, where the shots are more spontaneous and thinking of where to point the camera or keep what's in the frame is alot more crucial and I guess more thought is happening whilst operating it. There were 3 parts that I loved the camera work so much. 1. Imelda was at her garden flexing her framed photos and pics one up right in the middle. I guess her arm or dress snagged the other frames in the background that it went crashing down like dominoes. She watched frames crash with NO. FUCKING. EMPATHY. OR SIGN OF CONCERN –– WALA!!!! She just fucking looked at it fall, brushed it off and continued speaking about whoever the fuck she was with. While that was happening (and this is where I talk abt camera work) the cam ZOOOOMS out and shows one of her house help bending down to pick up the shattered pieces of her ""precious framed photos of her """"""""""friends"""""""""""""" Tangina nasugatan ba si Kuya?????? My heart goes for people employed under her, they don't deserve that. 2. Also with Imelda's house help. She was flexing this other HUGEASS picture frame of a newspaper clipping and she asked her househelp to hold it up. She was hiding herself from the camera but had one eye peeping in between the crook of her elbow. I saw her emotions and just felt so sorry for her. Idk what she was actually feeling ah but Idk it just feels wrong. 3. Imelda was again flexing this part of her house with again EXTRAVAGANT paintings and sculptures, the camera was at a medium wide which already was showing enough of the venue. But the cameraperson zoomed out slowly to reveal one of Imelda's house help trying to inch their way out of the frame to hide. But as he tried to inch himself out, the camera kept him in frame. I saw the back and forth and it just goes to show how they feel unworthy???? (for the lack of a better term) ALSO WOW JUST LAUREN GREENFIELD UR MIND I STAN She beautifully crafted this docu to reveal the truth about the Marcoses but not as an IN UR FACE U SUK type of way. But in a way that really digs deep into ur psyche and just makes u feel the anger to ur core. Correct me if I'm wrong, but If u watch this documentary it can be interpreted in 2 main ways. If you're a Marcos supporter you'd watch this and see scenes you agree. You'd agree with Imelda when she'd say she's the Matriarchal Saviour of the Philippines, you'd say Martial Law was a wonderful time for the PH. But if you had common sense, or you know,,,, in the eyes of the well informed, we really know what this docu is about and I will absolutely hate them for it. In the end it states that they're slowly finding their way back into PH Politics and I just cannot stand knowing we've got another batch of them.

They are genuinely the worst and it is saddening to see how quickly they have rose back to prominence. The film does a good job of building up Imelda as someone who at first seems okay only to later destroy her later on, particularly the sequences wherein Imelda would say one thing then would immediately be contradicted afterwards; it might be an effective way of getting the message across for someone who may be unaware of PH politics to not be sympathetic for them. And in the end, they are really the audience of this documentary. It scratches the surface with regards to the history of that time and circumstances of the now, and that's okay if it was intended to be that way.

alexroy656,6,"Very interesting and entertaining documentary on Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines who lived in a lavish lifestyle by plundering her nations wealthy, The Kingmaker is an in depth feature that chronicles her legacy. I found the film to be very good and shows that Marcos was quite deceptive and dishonest. It's quite an interesting film to watch and the way things are presented on-screen makes the viewer form his or hers own opinion on Marcos. The film is quite fascinating in what it does, yet I think more things could have been added to the film too. It's quite in depth, but the film could have been a bit longer too.

roynarra,7,"""They found no skeletons. Only beautiful shoes"" is just one of the many striking and unbelievable lines that came from former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos in Laura Greenfield's documentary ""The Kingmaker"". The line exhibits the nonagenarian's lavish perspective despite living in a third world country that suffered from the regime of her late husband and dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Greenfield's documentary shows how ""imeldific (ostentatiously extravagant)"" the mindset of Imelda despite the numerous human rights violations and embezzlement that happened during the Marcos regime. After all of her controversial past, it is beyond belief how Imelda is firm to declare that the Philippines was in its glory during Martial LawGreenfield portrays Imelda as someone who has a savior complex. Imelda believes that being the first lady means being a mother to everyone so she wants nothing but the best for Filipinos. She visits the streets while aboard her car and gives out money to children. She goes to the hospital and distributes huge bucks like its just coins to her. But being a mother is beyond giving money for Imelda. She wants to convert the country into a paradise that will be looked up by other countries. ""The Kingmaker"" gives light to the usually undiscussed Calauit Safari Park in Palawan. Imelda was in awe of Africa's beautiful safaris so she bought giraffes, zebras, monkeys, and more African animals and placed them on a small island. The film shows Imelda's inhumane mind when some residents of Calauit island detailed how the military evicted them in favor of the animals that are not even natives in the Southeast Asian Country. It later revealed that the animals there are not properly taken care of because of the absence of a veterinarian who specializes in safari animals. It's an antithesis to Imelda's own perception of being a mother to everything in the Philippines, showing that she's only obsessed with the aesthetic surfaceImelda has also risen to a new societal power when she was shown leading infrastructure projects and buying expensive New York buildings. At some point, it was also suggested that Imelda was the one running the country as her husband is falling ill. ""The Kingmaker"" shows Imelda as not just a first lady or the ""mother"" of Filipinos. She is also a puppeteer who can control everyone with the strings made out of Php 1,000 bills.Greenfield was able to show Imelda as an out-of-touch personality who still believes that her family has the solution to everything. However, one has got to ask if Greenfield wants to convince pro-Marcos and moderates to pick the other side. If she has that intention, unfortunately, The Kingmaker"" will just serve to them as a ""hate piece"" to the Marcos supporters and those who are in between. In fact, they may have encountered the 2003 documentary about Imelda but they are still firm on what they believe is right. Moreover, getting Marcos' opponents such as Vice President Leni Robredo and former President Noynoy Aquino (son of slain senator and fierce Marcos critic Benigno Sr.) as the opposing voices to Imelda will more likely fail to convince a lot of people. Hence, the discourse between the Pro- and Anti-Marcos will be just filled with tiring justifications of the authorities' actions.""Perception is real and the truth is not,"" Imelda said in the documentary. So, the question now is ""Which perception is Greenfield trying to appeal?"". Because if she's appealing to Marcos supporters, the documentary may lack in showing new information on Imelda's ridiculousness. Maybe except for the Calauit safari. The director could have focused her story on that island and meticulously unravel the fate of the residents and the animals there caused by Imelda's shallow vision of a perfect and paradise-like society.",2020-03-28T16:46:26.646Z,0,0,watch,False

nicoleemz,7,"The greatest performance of Imelda Marcos. Deserves an award for being the most conniving, manipulative, and self-centered human... or is she even considered one?

Imee just looks like the cheap dolls you get at divi — purely plastic. She even got her mother's big hair.Director Lauren Greenfield's documentary not only shows the two sides of politics in the Philippines, but also explains how perception is not that easy to deceive. From watching this film, I kept asking questions like ""How do the people not see it?"" or ""How did she get away with it?"". Honestly, Annalise Keating should take a lecture from her. You will see how quick and strategic the mind of the former first lady is which made things always go her way. I guess that's where her fallacious line ""Perception is real, truth is not"" comes in. We often attach ourselves to our beliefs and create layers of lies in order to protect them. There were a few significant events that were missed from the film. However, from what was shown I think it was enough to make you understand and even empathize on behalf of the victims. I hope that more people get a chance to watch and educate themselves of how power should not be in the hands of heartless people.Book recommendation: The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos by Primitivo Mijares",2020-03-29,1,0,watch,False

karasuno,8,"Before watching this documentary, I was afraid that it will paint the Marcoses and the late dictator’s term in a good light; that it might be another attempt of the Marcoses’ on historical revisionism. During elementary school, the Marcos regime is dubbed as “The Golden Age of the Philippines”. The usual narratives are: the Philippines was one of the richest countries in Asia; when Marcos declared martial law, there was peace and order; and that he ended poverty. A lot of students are growing up thinking that he was the best president the Philippines ever had. Even I, at one point, believed that. Fast forward to high school, the Marcos dictatorship is once again discussed along with martial law. There I learned that media companies are shut down to censor information, and that he imprisoned his political opponents. However, accounts of torture and murder are not discussed. As I grow older, I encounter more documentaries and articles proving that during his term was not “The Golden Age of the Philippines” (though it might be for his cronies). Now that information is more accessible with the help of the internet, more information regarding the crimes of the Marcoses are revealed. I remember watching a video on Facebook wherein young people who grew up believing that Marcos is the best president of the Philippines are sat down with a victim of martial law. After the young ones tell why they thought Marcos was good president, the victims then narrate how they were tortured by Marcos’ men. However, the internet has also given a platform to Marcos apologists to propagate the narrative that the Marcos regime was best because of his infrastructure projects. This documentary has let Imelda tell her story without letting her control the narrative. It changed my perception on her position as a first lady. She was more than a lavish woman who indulges in shoes. She was more than an accessory to her husband. Her image as the muse of Manila has helped Marcos ascend into power, and helped him in connecting with other world leaders. Until now, she’s one of the reasons why her children (even after all they have done to this country) has been elected into government positions.

ashursey,6,"I was 10 or 11 years old in 1986 when the Marcos family fled the Philippines. I knew nothing of martial law or potential human rights atrocities. I got my news like everyone else--from Johnny Carson. Imelda Marcos' shoe collection provided a bevy of fodder for late night comedians of the era. I'm surprised that no clips were inserted into this documentary.I found this film to be fine, but a bit disappointing over all. It was one I was very much looking forward to since it made the rounds at film festivals last year. I never get to go to these festivals, but I try to look at the programming guide and make a schedule as if I was going. I always tried to find room for this film in my make believe schedule. Luckily for me, this film was available as part of a free Showtime weekend on Sling, so my wait wasn't as long as it could have been.I think the film's structure is its biggest obstacle. Not presenting the film mainly in chronological order hurts the storytelling in my opinion. I think that the film would have been better served by showing some present day Imelda then going back to her marriage and really focus on the time of the Marcos presidency/dictatorship. I never really fully grasped the politics of the country based on this documentary. The film kind of jumps around too much to paint a full picture of what was happening to the Filipino people.Perhaps the most egregious part of the film comes at the end titles. There is a lot of interesting information that is thrown up there to read instead of using time to show it on film. We spend a lot of time with Leni Roberdo (who ran against Bongbong Marcos for Vice Presdient), but then learn she suddenly have all of these charges against her by a suspect President! I want to know more about that! Why even bother including it?Despite the, in my opinion, lack of focus the film seems to present, it is compelling to hear the thoughts of Imelda. She remains one of the most infamous people of the late 20th century. But I'm not sure that this film ever allows the viewer to fully know her.",2020-03-30,3,0,watch,False

kmp091,7,"It’s a cliffsnotes version of the last near decade in the Philippines, and I do think this is the type of cultural artifact that Filipino documentarians cannot really package and broadcast - at the very least for now.The docu’s biggest strength is the way it captures Imelda’s twisted way of thinking. It’s very natural for her to downplay a lot of history, and to drive the narrative convincingly. It’s the same power you see in archival footage of “the Conjugal Dictatorship”, and the same power that is insinuated as puppetry- or at least sponsorship- for the currently sitting Duterte. The nugget quote “Perception is real and the truth is not” is the ironic essence of our time, delivered by the patron saint of Filipino boomers herself. It’s a reminder that what seems new and surprising in the valley of fake news, is just what is and what has always been to a certain breed of alligator.It should be noted that the docu scopes out a lot of nuance, atrocities and products of her Edifice complex in favor of an introductory contrast between the Marcos era and their rise back to power today. Yes, it includes heart wrenching testimonies of essential Martial Law era dissenters, and their harrowing experiences are just the tip of the bloody iceberg. But understandably, you can’t package all nuance into a digestible document, and the target audience is composed of non-Filipinos - but letting them know about the basic stuff is still pretty important.But I think the most important thing they gloss over is the corruption and/or callousness of what came after (it is mentioned, but it could’ve used a few more minutes) and why a nostalgic rose colored filter has colored many of those who lived through the toppling of the Marcoses. There’s a lot in the docu that many critics of the Marcoses already put forward, and a lot that his staunch loyalists deny (or recontextualize), and it’s unlikely to change local perceptions. For those who live in the thick of the topic at hand, a different approach to the documentation of this era seems more fitting.In two more years, the Philippines will either experience another political shift, or lead up to this slow burn of a Marcos return. It’s hard to predict what the Imeldific Kingmaker’s strategy is going to be about, but it likely will be the opposite of beautiful.",2020-04-04,1,0,watch,True

We do not need to talk to the Marcoses to explore their evil. We do not gain insight by spending time in their palatial homes, with their art and their clothes and all the aspirational bullshit that makes them weird antiheroes in this broken oligarchic society.The best parts of this film are the parts where it talks to victims, where it talks to the poor. The film tries to be clever with its juxtapositions, but the end effect is that it still gives voice to the lies, still allows a truly evil person to revise history. It opens up the possibility of accusations of bias, and letting them play the victim yet again when all they've ever done is victimize the Filipino.There are no two sides when telling the story of the Marcoses. They stole from the country, and tortured and killed thousands of people.

heyarmi,6,"The Kingmaker feels like a double-edged sword.On one hand this documentary exposes Imelda Marcos for the thieving liar and delusional old bitch that she is. Lauren Greenfield, the director, uses a careful juxtaposition of Imelda's outlandish pronouncements with testimonies from people who suffered and continues to suffer under their power to further highlight how ridiculous and unrepentant she is. It also does a good job in exposing how they perpetrated mediocrity and impunity through her children who are now trying to reclaim the political clout that they lost years ago. There is an undercurrent of rage in the entire documentary, as we slowly see this rotten family rebuild their reputation through deceit and political connections. It ends on a terrifying note: she and her family insist that we forget the past and move on to pave the way for their return. Yet on the other hand, it also needs to be said that this documentary also gave another opportunity for the Marcoses to repeat their lies. It humanized them in a way, and made it seem that there is another ""unheard"" side to the narrative of our nation. As one of the activists tortured during Martial Law said, ""I don't have an answer why we allow Imelda to open her mouth."" And that's exactly what this movie did. It allowed her to speak freely. Bad publicity is still publicity for these vultures. I am afraid they can twist this in their favor, knowing how cunning they are and how ruthless their propaganda machine is.

mnugaspar,4,"Greenfield appeared more fascinated in than critical of Imelda as a singular political force. After all, Imelda made her out-of-touch decisions and delusions of grandeur unequivocally on her own terms. So when Imelda is framed as a “kingmaker” (for supporting Duterte, among other reasons), it fails to capture the frustrating circularity of Philippine politics; The Kingmaker disappoints inasmuch as it glosses over the political context Imelda thrives in and one that placed her back in power.This film is paler in comparison to - and most of the time repetitive of - Diaz’s Imelda (2003). For an unrepentant and corrupt political figure that has never been held to account, you can’t go soft; you go all out.

kim_cardassian,7,"“Perception is real, the truth is not.”Well, ain't that a 2010 quote if ever there was one.The Kingmaker is a documentary about the life and times of one Imelda Marcos, famous First Lady of the Philippines for 21 years. I was generally unaware of her history and her influence going into this, though I'm pretty sure I had an inkling about the shoe thing.The Kingmaker begins innocently enough, starting with Imelda herself. She goes through her history, her upbringing, her marriage, and her pride in the political power she had. She proclaims herself to be ""The mother of the nation,"" a symbol of hope to the masses. People love her, she says, and we're given no reason to think otherwise.Regular documentary viewers may know where this is going; we're being lulled into a false sense of security, before the filmmakers blindside us with a right hook and say, ""No, actually, this is how all that really went down.""And how. It becomes clear as The Kingmaker goes on that what we're seeing is a portrait of a raging narcissist, an inconsiderate dictator, and, in all likelihood, a mass-murderer. The film is directed by Lauren Greenfield, and while I've not seen any of her previous documentaries, I can tell looking at their descriptions - The Queen of Versailles in 2012, and Generation Wealth in 2018 - that The Kingmaker falls right into her wheelhouse of examining and deconstructing the insanity of the rich and powerful.Right from the start, Imelda Marcos cuts a fascinating, and infuriating, figure. The first thing we see her do in the film is ride around in her luxury limousine, passing by scenes of abject poverty and complaining, ""This used to be my little paradise. In my time, there were no beggars."" Somehow, I don't believe her. Later, we see her handing out giant wads of money to random passersby. This is something we see her do a bit, and we come to understand it's a regular occurrence; she will frequently walk around, or ride around in busses, handing out money to the impoverished masses, who obviously respond with gratitude. That's how she wins their hearts and minds, see.The film plays a tricky game with Imelda Marcos. Right from the start, we're encouraged to not take her at face value; the film highlights the inherently ridiculous nature of her appeals to mass popularity, and her assurance that she's just as powerful and beloved as she was in her prime, when none of that is clearly true. Basically, she begins the film as a clown, a totally ridiculous figure ripe for mockery. Not knowing the extent of her vileness, I assumed that this was a documentary about how a country was damaged through incompetence.Imelda Marcos begins The Kingmaker as a joke, and ends it as a monster. As the net of the documentary's eye widens, and more and more talking heads emerge to tell their stories of what it was actually like under Marcos dictatorship, the film repeatedly returns to Imelda's silent, resilient gaze, and we're forced to ask: ""Surely, there's no way you didn't know about this, right? After all, you were just bragging about how you were the secret power behind your husband. Surely, you knew?""In many ways, The Kingmaker is the perfect documentary for our time. because Imelda Marcos IS a clown; she's a vain, pompous, egotistical fool who at one point insists to the camera that she could've solved all the world's problems, because all the world leaders just found her so charming. But behind all that, there's this twisted image of a frilly despot, lounging away as her country starves, and her people are tortured. By her.The Kingmaker I think does an excellent job at painting Imelda Marcos into a corner from which she can't escape, using cutaway evidence and cross-testimony, all while keeping her unaware that this ""puff-documentary"" is actually a hit piece. I appreciate that there's never really a moment that The Kingmaker allows her to seem sincere; even when the extent to her monstrosity isn't quite apparent, she comes across as a complete egomaniac, with way too much while her country has way too little.But then things get serious, fast. There are hints as to something darker lurking under the surface early on; how she talks about the period of martial law being a golden age, or how she keeps the body of her husband perfectly preserved behind glass, which is just a horrific image. But then we hear about how she imported all these exotic animals to an island, only to abandon the project after the animals proved to be more trouble than they were worth. Those animals are still there, as cross-breeding catastrophes. We hear about the Tunnel of Love, which was built by Imelda's husband for her, and then became the name of a particularly grisly method of torture. And we follow a series of money trails, the end result of which is that the Marcos family seems to have been robbing their country blind.Even more worryingly, the film will frequently cut to the present, where we see Imelda masterminding her son's campaign to be Vice President of the Philippines (Vice President there is different than in America; it's a separate election than that of the President, and the VP generally has more responsibility than they do here), with the money she seems to have stolen directly from the people. It's here that the film begins to lose me a little; by playing with nonlinear chronology, it sometimes becomes hard to track the exact order of events as they happened. And every once in a while, I did find myself wondering, ""I wonder what was happening in the rest of the world at around this time?"" But the film does succeed at painting a portrait of wealthy insanity, damningly well. The image of Imelda Marcos, now elderly, on the cusp of re-achieving political dominance and still in complete denial about her family's evil legacy, is appropriately chilling.“There are so many things in the past that we should forget. In fact, it’s no longer there.”",2020-04-15T20:39:48.651Z,6,1,watch,False

I think this is an example of really great, holistic documentary making. I came out of this with a much greater understanding of the topic without it being too bogged down in talking head interviews.

filmfanaticcc,8,"""Perception is real, and the truth is not.""All I knew about Imelda Marcos was that she was basically the Filipina version of Jackie Kennedy, with her terno sleeves and thousands of pairs of shoes. When the documentary starts, she talks about her role as a First Lady, her husband's infidelities, and her commitment to her country, not as a political official, but as a mother figure. As the film continues, it's clear that Marcos's ""mothering"" of the nation was nothing more than widespread mismanagement of government funds, corruption, and human rights abuses. I think that the documentary could have introduced this ""side"" of her sooner, because the first half an hour leads us to believe that she was a formidable force in Philippine politics who was relegated to the sidelines because of her sex. Maybe that's the editing, but it probably has something to do with Marcos's masterful manipulation skills. She knows what to say and how to spin situations, so the documentary is much more powerful when juxtaposing her propaganda with the testimony of real-life witnesses to her crimes. Crimes which, unfortunately, are not explored with much depth. I wish more time had been spent on martial law and her money laundering. However, the half an hour spent on the Marcos family's attempts to re-infiltrate Philippine politics is incredible. They've worked with the current president to arrest their opposition, jail the VICE PRESIDENT, and rig the Supreme Court, all to make Marcos Jr. the president. Imelda Marcos mentions that the country is full of ""forgiving"" people who love her because she was a ""good mother"" to them. I hope that, despite all their forgiving, the people don't forget.""Now is the important thing, and the past is the past. There are so many things in the past that we should forget.

rodrigosays,8,"Being first generation American Filipino, I always crave any film that has to do with the motherland. Anything Asian really, perhaps because of the lack of representation? ahem ahem. And I notice there really aren’t many documentaries available about the Philippines (MAJOR lack of representation, being that we’re ALL over America and the world AHEM AHEM). But I digress.This documentary is a reflection of Philippines’ political history. It focuses on the reign of the Marcoses. Growing up in Hawaii I would here praises of the Marcoses, so I had a biased opinion of them already. But this documentary sheds some light on that. Any other people and also the opposing party know that the Marcoses ran a dictatorship and hid it under the pretense of democracy. He even enacted martial law and still I heard/and hear people praise him.Is this due to propaganda? Is it fake news? Is this just one side of the story? Many people say that the Aquinos were no different in their corruption. But this documentary does show the facts. Imelda was excessive, the Philippines is an impoverished country, and the citizens are broken.It also hints a stark comparison between the current reigning presidency and America’s current dicta- Ahem AHEM AHEM president. It’s chilling to think that America could one day follow in the dark past of the Philippines. The silver lining was seeing the stories of the survivors. There was a great quote, which I can’t remember of course, but to paraphrase it was something like, the power of democracy elects the president, and revolts ousts them. It shows that you can break the the country and it’s people, but you can not break their spirit. The revolution that ended the regime was a way to move forward. But the fight seems never ending.Alas, as long as there is corruption in government, the power will stay with the rich.

ryanmakuch,7,"I'm not super familiar with Laura Greenfield's work, but in my limited knowledge of Generation Wealth and The Queen of Versailles, this is the perfect follow-up to those. I took a course about the history of the Phillippines and while it focused heavily on pre-1900s Phillippines, we, of course, discussed the Marcos regime towards the end of the class. Imelda Marcos is a fascinating character. The Marcos Family itself is just full of heinous characters. Ferdinand Marcos, obviously. But throughout the film, we also learn about Imelda and Bongbong, each awful in their own ways. It's a fascinating look in general at a nation that is going through and has gone through a TON of corruption in its recent history. Imelda is a perfect focus on a documentary like this not just because she is arguably one of the most powerful first ladies in all of the world's modern history, but because she is the perfect snapshot of obscene wealth. Imelda has Monet and Picasso paintings and an obscene amount of shoes and clothes. This all happening in a country that is shown to be going through a significant struggle with many of its citizens facing poverty. What puts this film over the top is that it's well-made. The title, The Kingmaker, refers to Imelda, not just with her husband and how she carried so much power especially socially, but we see her trying to build up her son to become that 'king' of the family in the present day. We also see the Marcos Family trying to make the 'king' of Duterte in order to get Bongbong in power quicker. The aspects of a photography shoot just went on to further highlight Imelda's ridiculous wealth. Perhaps most importantly, though, there is the discussion with opponents of the Marcos power that is able to contradict anything that Imelda may be lying about. This is not a film that glorifies Imelda by any means. It doesn't necessarily deal her a vicious takedown, but rather it gives the audience all the tools we need to make the obvious conclusion that Imelda, despite her sob stories and giving out pity-pay to begging children, is neither a good person, nor worthy of our sympathy.There are tons of incredible and sympathetic characters in this film, though. May Rodriguez's story is truly inspiring. Andy Bautista moving to Oklahoma after investigating Imelda out of fear of Duterte and Marcos is harrowing. The residents of the island that the Marcoses used for their private zoo share their story and it's beyond tragic. The zoo animals are the key metaphor for me. It's the tale of the Marcos Family starting something extremely extravagant, funding it well, then dropping it. Now, the animals just linger there, affected by inbreeding and disease. The ignoring of the animals mirrors the ignoring of the people in the Marcos regime and the refusal to own up and help in any real, tangible, way. Money to beggars on the street will not make up for the years of martial law and tactics used to whitewash history in the favor of Marcos.I think there are some occasions where this feels like it can drag, and by the end of the film it almost feels like an entirely different film than the start. I think that was intentional, but at times it almost seems to lose its own train of thought. I'd have rather had more Imelda stuff mixed in rather then leading with her biography -- but it truly wasn't too affecting to me. This is a well-made biographical documentary that is worth a watch because of how incredible it is.",2020-05-09T04:57:20.975Z,1,0,watch,False

kareg6,8,"Knowing nothing about history of the Philippines, the Marcos Family or Ferdinand Marcos' time ruling the country, at first this seemed like a documentary about the melancholy Imelda Marcos feels for long lost power and youth. Then you start learning about everything Imelda and her husband did during his presidency (dictatorship, I learned) and how the family is not nearly over with politics.What makes this documentary interesting and good is how it starts with the point of view of Imelda, hence the melancholic tone, and as the director slowly introduces new characters the tone starts to turn into something darker and quite ugly. This keeps the spectator's attention even though it is, in the end, as most expository documentaries, a history lesson.",2020-05-12,1,0,watch,False

joshie16,2,"“I don’t have an answer for why we even allow Imelda to open her mouth”The Kingmaker has the potential to be a protest documentary showcasing the Marcos problem before and now. But as the producers are thrown an issue that they can strike and provide a quality documentary exposing the Marcos dirt, they miss and instead give us a mediocre retelling of the dictatorship and a lousy exposition of a rising Marcos-like dictatorship in the county.There’s so much missing from The Kingmaker that irks me, and it’s all because of how reactionary it is.If what the documentary implies is that the Marcoses did so much bad things in the Philippines, then why would the documentary continue to just say “Marcos bad, and marcos continue to be bad”—why not go the extra mile? I was expecting for the documentary to go on a deep dive when they played the Marcos-Dovie Beams sex tape recording, because that recording is very rare. Sadly, the documentary only covers the tip of the iceberg.It also becomes reactionary as the Filipino people also become only extras in this film. Marcoses are the evil ones, Aquinos restored democracy, Duterte is Marcos part II. No, this is not the case and just asserts the status quo of Philippine politics in which someone has to be the face of fascism or the resistance. The film forgets that Marcos had cronies and was backed by the imperialist U.S., the film forgets that the Filipino people and many grassroots activists started the movements against Marcos, the film forgets that the Aquinos also became like Marcos and killed activists and farmers, and the film also skips over the numerous large anti-Marcos burial protests. The film forgets the most essential people: the Filipino people that she oppressed, and the people that ousted her.I know you’re wondering, “This is a documentary about Imelda, why look into a broader perspective?”Because the film implies it. The film implies that the Marcoses did bad things, so why not go deeper and deeper into exposing that. Why not go deeper into the Oplan Tokhang and other human rights violation we continue to face here in the Philippines? This was released in 2019, and there has been so much things skipped over. The documentary tries to be a strong anti-Marcos film, but just becomes a reflection of the political atmosphere of the country: figure-based, glossing over information, and negligent of the actual plight of the masses.MARCOS, DUTERTE, WALANG PINAGIBA!

decadentrebel,4,"""The Kingmaker"" is woefully short and doesn't really break any new ground when it comes to telling the Marcos story. We've seen and heard this before just with the added ""revelation"" that Duterte is their proxy candidate — which is kinda obvious already back then even without tin foil hats. If the goal is to make their transgressions known more, I doubt it'll work because you can't convince the pro-Marcos/DDS guys to listen to anything that slights their idols. If you want to ""correct"" how the youth perceives Martial Law then that's the institutions fault, not a documentary's job. And the voters that matter (the EFG class) likely wouldn't have access to it and probably wouldn't care anyway since the documentary explicitly shows that you can easily subjugate them by doling out cash (and I don't blame them). The middle class already know them and what they did (and mostly loathe them for it), so you're preaching to the choir.What I wanted to see (and disappointingly didn't) was Miriam Santiago since she was part and parcel of that attempt to consolidate the family's power grab and an unapologetic supporter dating back to her days as their speech writer — yet escaped that entire chapter unscathed and with her public image of this revered meritocratic what-if intact. Hell, she's still clawing her way into our social media feeds despite lying six feet under many years later (e.g. alleged clairvoyant of the pandemic with a bill she filed once but never bothered to follow through).

reeladvicenet,9,"""The Kingmaker"" is subtle with how it depicts the cunning and devious ways of Imelda Marcos. Actually, it's up to you as the viewer to decide who to side with - Imelda's words or the stories of those who have been oppressed by her family's decisions in the past. Regardless, ""The Kingmaker"" is a well-balanced documentary that is entertaining as it is cunningly disturbing.It's the 2016 elections and Imelda Marcos is on a mission to make her son Bongbong Marcos the next vice president of the Philippines. Along the way, we get to know the life and the psyche of the woman before she married Ferdinand Marcos, their power during his presidency, and the eventual downfall of their family in 1986 People Power revolution, and their plot to wipe off her family's sinister reputation especially with the younger generation.From its first few minutes, we see Imelda Marcos calm, cool, and collected. Her charm undeniable and even we, as Filipinos, started believing her words. But Lauren Greenfield does amazing work as she subtlety unveils the perceptive reality that Imelda tries to convey against the backdrop of real people who experienced great tragedy through the actions of her and Ferdinand Marcos. The film's tagline uses Imelda's own words that ""Perception is real, and the truth is not."" is the very real horror in this film. If ever she believes her own lies or lies to the heart to get away with guilt, the truth is that almost everything she started failed to prosper in the long run. It's a reflection of both past wrongs that her family did and the present wrongs that Filipinos are experiencing with its modern politicians. Surprisingly, Lauren Greenfield doesn't force much to assassinate the character of Imelda Marcos as Imelda herself unravels herself. The documentary doesn't really side with any party equally portraying the biases of the other camp. Overall, ""The Kingmaker"" is a film that every Filipino should watch. It's a warning sign that we really need to remember the sins of the past and that our forgiving nature as a populace is our own undoing in the long run.Source: www.reeladvice.net/2020/05/the-kingmaker-movie-review.html",2020-05-16,3,0,watch,False

queenellouise,9,"Throughout the film there were various commentaries from people and the fact that they weren't positioned in the same background with the exact same static angle was very interesting- each person that gave a commentary gave it in the comfort of either their own home or office with a full frontal view, giving off a feeling of rawness and vulnerability as they spoke, luring the audience to full believe in what they say. In terms of audio, there was one mellow melancholy tune that would play whenever a devastating/unfortunate event was brought up, which would of course elevate the feeling of loss and damage- these two feelings are important because that's the main goal of the documentary: for the people to feel the loss and damage that has happened to the Philippines and the people because of the abuse of power by the Marcos family.Although the film revolved around Imelda, I deeply appreciated how it did not feel biased at all. The people behind the film didn't just interview and capture people in awe of Imelda, but also brought in people who found the family and their doings unjust. You would expect this documentary to be very one-sided, but instead you get two sides battling each other- although it's subtle in the documentary, it's something that is actually happening in real life in the Philippines even up to today.It was clear that Imelda was trying to paint this picture-perfect image of herself to the audience. She repeatedly states that she lost her mother and that she believes she is the mother of the Philippines and that she ""birthed"" all these great and beautiful things, my only question is: where? Throughout the film I could feel nothing but indecencies coming out of her mouth. I firmly believe in ""actions speak louder than words"" and there's one scene in the whole documentary that really stood out to me- the scene where Imelda picks up the frame and the other frames fall on the floor. She acts as if nothing happened, she does not even acknowledge, and she goes on and talks about the picture frame she's holding as a worker of her shyly cleans up the broken pieces of glass on the floor. This scene is really interesting as she says all these good things about herself and all yet a small act such as recognizing the frames falling and seeing the worker clean up after her she cannot acknowledge and help. This is very reminiscent of her as a first lady and the Marcos Family- they see what they want and they get it without hesitation, complete unaware of the mess they left behind for the Filipinos to clean up. In addition, throughout the film she mentions that throughout her reign as first lady, she was friends with powerful people all across the globe, further proving how unaware she is of her and herhusband’s doings. She states that she is disgusted with how the government and Philippines is now however she is completely delusional as she doesn’t realize that her and her family has contributed to how the Philippines is no longer “paradise”.Lastly, it’s interesting how this film was made by someone that is not a Filipino. I’m not sure why someone who has no close ties to the Philippines would make a documentary about something so notorious, however, perhaps the fact that it’s so notorious is probably the reason why it was made by the director in the first place. I wondered why no one in the Philippines has made something like this- is it because we are scared of the consequences? Is it because it would be full of bias? Whatever the reason is, I think that the fact this film was made by someone looking at the outside in really gives us a non-biased and equal perspective, as well as a clear division on fact and truth.My gripe with this documentary is how it felt that it shifted to Duterte and that it meandered from Imelda and the main topic on hand, however, I can't really rule this out as the documentary was stating facts and the fact about the Marcos' funding Duterte was vital for people to know.This film was a beautiful yet disturbing layout of Philippine History. Everything was presented in a way that would benefit the feeling and mood of the film. It’s definitely not for people who are very sensitive to the Marcos’ as this film obviously dives deep into them and Imelda’s delusions. Imelda may have thought that this film would bring her and her family justice, however personally, it just justified why the Philippines and its people are having hardships today.Cheers to Lauren Greenfield and her team for doing a fantastic job.",2020-05-21T08:05:53.737Z,1,0,watch,False

mayfirst,9,"Disclaimer: This is gonna get political due to the fact that I am anti-Marcos and have strong sentiments against dictatorship and media censorship.The Marcos regime has remain to be the most controversial administration in the Philippines. Not only for the numerous allegations and charges that they face, but also for the parade of affluence and wealth of their family. As per the records of anti-corruption agencies, their family has been accused of corruption, violation of human rights, and just recently, perpetration of fake news.Corruption is heavily evident and prevalent in the country. From the local sectors to the national government, it is known to be the root cause of poverty, crime and poor education system. During the Marcos administration, it has been reported that the amount of their so-called ‘ill-gotten wealth’ amount to billions worth of US dollars. In this documentary, they showed some of the acquired properties given to Imelda by his late husband, whom she claimed to be generous for procuring the overseas assets from his hard-earned money. He showered her with innumerable luxurious jewelries and glamorous clothing; All throughout their ruling, Imelda lived like a queen. Hence, the obscene lifestyle and wealth enabled the dictator to extend his presidency and maintain their power that ultimately led to more contentious advances.People power eventually transpired amid chaos fueled by the assassination of Senator Ninoy Aquino; However, it should be noted that it was not the main reason why the resistance emerged. Martial law had been implemented for 8 years – the dark times in Philippine history when human rights and freedom of speech were unheard of - in response to burgeoning hostility that place their throne under threat. Some of the victims, who were mostly activists, spoke of their personal accounts of torture and sexual harassment inflicted onto them by the military/police officials. There were approximately 35,000 Filipinos who went through the same traumatizing experience for speaking out against the misconducts of the government. Opposition groups were silenced, and the media was shutdown. The only voice ever allowed to be heard was from the Conjugal leaders whose reign finally ended after the historic revolution.Until now, the country’s perception of the Marcoses is considerably divided due to the propaganda planted to uphold the legacy of their family name. Despite the charges against them, they still cling onto their false conviction of being trustworthy and country-loving officials as the piles of papers become obsolete edifices. The agencies that are tasked to investigate their family failed to bring them to court and make them admit to their blatant wrongdoings, which is saddening on my end as it’s been ages since the bloody dictatorship took place. Nonetheless, the dark turn of events in the past in relation to the Marcoses’ political careers did not halt the desire to make Malacañang their home once again. In 2016, Bong Bong Marcos, ran for the elections to become Vice President but was greeted by a narrow defeat by Leni Robredo. Since then, he has been attempting to prove that the incumbent VP cheated the elections and thwarted his ascendancy to the position for their contrasting political parties. He had to come up with a plan to gain support from the people and resort to the most accessible propaganda machine: social media. Based on the data gathered from Cambridge Analytica, President Duterte and Bong Bong Marcos are the biggest users of trolls for spreading fake news particularly on Facebook in the Philippines.In my opinion, the administration of Marcos has put the Philippines on the line. Never again to Martial Law. Never again to the dreary cycle of fraudulent conduct, abuse of power, and proliferation of revisionists that are bound to resurface as these unlawful acts are deeply ingrained in their name. Political dynasties ruin the foundation of governance and neglect the needs of the Filipino citizens in favor of their personal interests. Thus, the only way to elude the same fate is to hold the perpetrators accountable and never ever elect them again.",2020-04-30,3,0,watch,True

2centsplus,9,"This is a really great documentary. On the surface it is a film about the controversial former first lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos. In reality, though, this film is about something much deeper, an inside look at the troubling dynastic political landscape of the Southeast Asian country. The Marcos presidency was one marked by scandal, corruption, and crime. The film allows Marcos to provide her version of events, her side of the story, but Lauren Greenfield is too smart a filmmaker to allow Marcos to control the narrative. Greenfield is brilliant in how she sets up her scenes, including moments before and after a given 'take' that showcase and highlight Marcos' narcissism and penchant for self indulgence. Greenfield also provides contrasting points of view, footage that provides context, background, and that conflicts with and juxtaposes the words Imelda Marcos spews. This is a woman whose control and corruption are well known and documented, and Greenfield, a director who makes films about the rich and powerful without glorifying their lifestyles but in fact showcasing everything wrong with them, is the person to tell this story.Eventually the film shifts from being a biodoc on Marcus to the current political landscape in the Philippines, Marcos pushing her son to run for president, and the corrupt state of the Filipino political world and how power is constantly transferred between members of the same few families and how little it has to do with the good of the people, who do not factor in at all with the story, they're not even backdrop for the rich, powerful, and influential, and Greenfield makes this abundantly clear. For the Marcos family, and anyone else running the country, it is all about power, wealth, and notoriety and nothing else. Their aspirations are as vacuous as their sense of taste - they accumulate so much, but ultimately all they have to show for it is a lifetime of horrific behavior, crimes against humanity, and a dark soul and evil heart. Bravo Greenfield! This is how you make a doc about someone and make it mean something!",2020-06-12,0,0,watch,True

Unfortunately, it’s also about how her family, who has stolen billions that the country is still trying to repay, has slowly returned to power. The Kingmaker never clearly states who is telling the truth. It just shows you Imelda Marcos’ account of events during the Marcos dictatorship, then pits that account against what everyone else is saying. The stories of the experiences of Martial Law victims are particularly heartbreaking, but it doesn’t end there. Just as heartbreaking are scenes where current students in a Metro Manila high school are asked about what happened during Martial Law, and their answers range from “our country’s golden age” to “there was peace and order.” And now Imelda is a member of Congress, Imee is a Senator, and Bongbong was a few hundred thousand votes away from being Vice President. The docu is not without its shortcomings, but more people need to see this. Because they need to know. Because we must never forget.PS.

brettbuckalew,7,"Documentary filmmaker Lauren Greenfield established with THE QUEEN OF VERSAILLES a talent for digging into and laying bare how the obscenely wealthy will stop at nothing in the pursuit for luxurious, expensive goods that make them feel validated in their gilded bubble of privilege. With THE KINGMAKER, Greenfield extends her fascination with this habitual overindulgence to the realm of politics, where a rich person's gluttonous spending and consuming means that money is being denied to a whole lot of people whose welfare the rich person is ostensibly meant to care for. Former First Lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos is the focus of Greenfield's probing, involving study of despotic decadence, and when we're given a glimpse of a closet housing Marcos' 1,000+ pairs of nice shoes, it's pretty impossible as an American viewer not to think of how our current President once counted a solid gold toilet as one of his prized possessions.As an interview subject, Marcos is more shrewd at polite evasions and even-tempered rationalizations than Trump ever has been, so Greenfield's interviews with Filipino activists, former political prisoners, and other residents end up being more illuminating than her sit-downs with the woman at the film's center. But while the lack of hugely revealing soundbites from Marcos is a flaw of this solid documentary, it's not one that Greenfield should realistically shoulder the blame for. If non-fiction filmmakers focusing on politics were expected to find and interview only wealth-hoarding rulers who are as rivetingly dumb and vicious as Trump is, it's likely they'd never get any work done.",2020-07-06T00:32:55.279Z,0,0,watch,False

paperslayer,9,"It's pretty crazy how charisma works on many levels. In The Kingmaker, we see explore this through the Marcos regime and its aftermath (and perhaps future).We see Imelda sitting in her apartment, surrounded by the riches and the beauty she always seems to strive for. Some can probably note the piece behind her as something in the style of Picasso, and yes, it is definitely a Picasso. She even proudly confirms this herself.Imelda has a way with words. She interweaves her personal stories with sentiment, nostalgia, and this whole schtick with maternity (I'll get to that later). It's as sugar-coated as it is convincing, especially if you don't know much about the Marcos family or if your Filipino history game is a bit lacking. Outsiders who are out of the loop may sympathise, and the Filipino viewers -- most of who are tired and weary -- may even be captivated by her through their last shred of hope. But this is where it gets good. I really like how Greenfield lets Imelda talk, then juxtaposes it with accounts from multiple people. The selection was very interesting, with the roster including people who sympathise with -- and fought against --the Marcos regime back in those days. It even includes people who are currently in office (at least during the time of this review). Then suddenly you, the viewer, realise that Imelda's words are like a house of cards. My favourite example of this is Calauit Island, where Greenfield not only tells but shows exactly what exactly it had done to both the animals and people who lived there decades later. This style of show-and-perhaps-contradict repeats throughout the documentary, and Greenfield lets it all speak for itself. You, the viewer, doesn't really have to be told outright that Imelda is a narcissist: it just comes out. She tries to hide it around this whole thing about how she is the, and I loosely quote, ""mother of the world"". That it perfectly justifies the reason why her son should be in power, and how they were actually doing a good thing (this includes her husband's regime). But through the help of the accounts of others, The Kingmaker paints a disturbingly beautiful picture created by the brushstrokes of horror, pain, and struggle that trickles down even in modern Filipino society. While Imelda sits in places of extravagance, and The Kingmaker, does not hesitate in making us remember where exactly all that money came from. A few notes:- Trigger warning on sexual abuse and torture. I was honestly so mad the whole time May Rodriguez was telling her story. I was so mad for her, and mad that she experienced what she did. Sexual abuse is never okay. - @ the guy who had to pick up those glass shards: I see you, and you are valid.- Does require a basic knowledge of who Marcos is and everything. Since this whole doc is mostly focused on Imelda and their lifestyle, it doesn't delve deep into more of the questionable stuff they've done.- I'd say this doc requires a viewer who is open-minded and can look at things objectively. If you are considering to showing this to your nanay, tatay, and other members of the family, I'd say your chances of making them reconsider their stances are 50/50. I found that it's very easy to attach yourself to Imelda + family and ignore everyone else in this doc, especially if your (insert family member here) has an aversion to Leni Robredo -- who shares a decent amount of screen time in this doc.",2020-07-18,0,0,watch,True

This came out ingenuine. It wants to be colored using the feministic lens that it failed to deliver that there are also women who cultivate and enable murderers. And, who's to say that the Filipino people are incapable of nurturing tyrannical kings too?The Kingmaker fosters the perception that Imelda protects so much. In her words, ""Perception is real, and the truth is not."" Her audacity to say that truth is subjective takes me to my wit's end. Plus, the way she keeps talking about the ultimate goal of her life is to birth a country nourished by her ""motherly"" traits, and, for a while, she's been blessed to be that mother—the Filipino's mother, our mother. If I don't tell you right now ma'am. The only blessing you've received is having a mouth and you've already sinned the moment you opened it.

They're in a land where they are not welcome, and their inbreeding is almost a tactic to force themselves to remain here—a land that's not theirs to rein. The locals of Calauit gets it. Every day, this mini zoo serves as a reminder that the country is a living circus with power-thirsty freaks. Punyeta hahaI wish the film could have centered more on the victims. They were already there—they interviewed the right people, made them resurface the trauma that stemmed from the injustices during Marcos' regime. It was unfair to give this woman a spotlight.

queegqueeg,8,"The Kingmaker is a 2019 documentary film written and directed by Lauren Greenfield, featuring the political career of Imelda Marcos with a focus on the Marcos family's efforts to rehabilitate the family's image and to return to political power, including her plans to see her son Bongbong become President of the Philippines, and the alliance that Bongbong and Imee Marcos established with Rodrigo Duterte in his bid to win the 2016 Philippine presidential election.This documentary lays bare the vile nature of the political strategies deployed by the Marcos family. Ferdinand Marcos is deservedly portrayed as a fascist capitalist dictator. But their greed and lust or power does not stop there. After Ferdinand dies and is denied a funeral in the Philippines, they deploy covert secret strategic tactics to regain power, status and regain their former political reign. They abuse social media to spread lies, use smear campaigns to get back their political power, kill power, oust people who intervene in their plans. The list of vile crimes is endless. I was shocked by the fact that the Philippine people still believed in the Marcos family even after Ferdinand Marcos had 30.000 people killed. For some unknown reason they still vote for Imee Marcos, Ferdinand's daughter, and later on even for Bong Bong, Ferdinand's son. Thd most vile betrayal is the political ruse of letting the people believe that Duterte is a better option than Imelda Marcos. In actuality the Marcos family had struck a deal with Duterte, a former minister in Marcos' government, for the mere purpose of letting Duterte become president. Once Duterte becomes president he removes all those who do not agree with Marcos' views. Duterte when inaugurated acts just like his former co-conspirator Ferdinand Marcos. Hence he kills people. and keeps the people in check by oppression. Duterte even abolishes the PCGG, the committee which works towards getting all the money stolen by Marcos. The leader of the PCGG is charged with corruption and fraud. Similar action are taken against the vice president Robredo. At present, Duterte has imprisoned most people who oppose Marcos. Furthermore, Imee has become a senator in the northern region of the Philippines. Duterte, and the Marcos family are now working towards having Bong Bong inaugurated as the new president of the Philippines.

It’s unthinkable how power concentrated in the hands of two people—herself and her husband, back when he was still President—could rip apart the lives of millions, but this documentary leaves no stone unturned in its unflinching exploration of history as shaped by them.The first half of the documentary is laughable, satirical almost, as one listens to Imelda’s own retelling of past events, perfected to a crisp with rehearsed smoothness. But the second half is a punch in the stomach, once Greenfield pieces together various stories regarding the political scene in the Philippines to flesh out a portrait of greed, corruption, lavishness and cruelty that now runs through generations. Not only do the effects of the Marcos regime still reverberate deeply through the country today, it feels almost as if they have never left with their relentless quest to return to power.

tertle_16,10,"In this day and age where corruption is widespread in my own land, it is most disheartening to see these political families achieve the full potential of their own charisma towards the blind masses. Backstabbing is irrelevant in my country as these politicians outrightly plunder from their own people. Filipinos are groaning and moaning since the Spanish rule, but to have this injustice come from your own countrymen is truly disgusting.Although unique from each other, the message is the same with the strong contemporary documentaries released within the first years of President Duterte’s administration such as A Thousand Cuts and Aswang. Compared with the two however, Lauren Greenfield’s film is more well-edited, hinting parallelisms from the past Marcos administration with the current government, making Imelda Marcos as the bridge that kept filling the gap between the two. Grandiose and almost royal in manner, I see Imelda in a two-headed monster having one neck that is filled of delusions of grandeur. The monster’s other head died, and as the head was cut off and laid unfortunately to rest amongst the honorables, one head continues to rise. And with these heads, a neck kept on and keeps on turning these heads to serve their own selfish purpose. This ardent and repugnantly wide neck is Imelda herself. Being true to her brand, Imelda blatantly shows wealth, which is a manifestation of her own understanding of beauty and love. But hidden beneath her clamor were the suffering of many Filipinos: from the residents of Calauit island to the murder and rape victims of Martial Law and to all the Filipinos, to whom the Marcoses are still accountable for. She stood by Ferdinand Marcos dictatorial rule and she’s standing by Bongbong’s political route to power. The rise and fall and their rising again feels like that Filipinos are inside a horror movie wherein it doesn’t matter how many times you kill the monster. Rest assured that after the end credits, a resurrection will be shown, which will birth a series of never-ending sequels. A truly scary state for an already aching country, a disease-stricken country.With our body there are lots of checks and balances that maintain homeostasis. Likened to a well-oiled machine, it is very organized up to a certain point wherein a harmful external factor can damage the whole organism. With my country, it seems that there’s a gradual reversal of this homeostasis. Slowly creeping in in the very own checks and balances of this country’s institutions. And without recognition from its own members, it will persist, continually making the whole country sick and killing its people one by one until there are no more Filipinos worth dying for.As a healer by profession, I tend to the sick. And whenever I encounter patients who I know have a lower chance of survival, wherein limitations of science and the practice of medicine are fully exhausted, it eats me to the core. There is so much that I can do to save a life, but one can’t save them all. The same feeling of hopelessness is what I feel with my country. A dim reflection I know, but by not stating this singular groan from a citizen, societal problems will not be recognized. And with this film it serves this purpose: recalling the past, stating the present and heeding a warning for the future.",2020-08-06,1,0,watch,True

arableofparable,8,"""If these people [the Marcoses] will be brought to power again, there's a very big chance that the sins of the past will be committed again in the future.""The Kingmaker managed to acclimate the political situation here in the Philippines, both then and now. When I was 8 years old, I remember my father brought a CD of Imelda (2003) when he came home from work in Manila. I had a vague memory of me watching this film on TV, together with my family, when Netflix or any streaming services weren't concepted yet. Little did I know that beyond the tapestry of all Imelda's extravagant furniture and her infamous 3,000 pair of shoe collection shown in the film, is a lady who stood by a tyrant and a dictator, who's ill-gotten wealth is being paid off by the Filipino people up to this very moment.What's even more baffling is the fact that in The Kingmaker, Imelda claims that the era of Martial Law in the Philippines upheld ""sovereignty, freedom, justice, and human rights"" in our country. Excuse me, Ma'am? Last time I checked, the Martial Law era perpetuated exactly the opposites of what you claimed--it was the darkest and most brutal time in the Philippines. Journalists were executed, activists were tortured and arrested, and newspaper outlets were silenced. I am outraged. It saddens me how students here define Marcos' era as being peaceful and disciplined, as per reflected in the documentary. It's as though all extrajudicial killings, arrests, and tortures never even took place. I really hope colleges would mandatorily employ Martial law studies in order to revisit the past, and scrutinize where things have gone wrong. I'm glad how this documentary also pointed out the current Duterte Administration. Vis-a-vis Marcos' era as a point of reference, I could enunciate a number of similarities between their presidencies. It's like reliving the past and the horrors all over again.

benkinneyh,8,"“I was always criticized for being excessive, but that is the spirit of mothering! You cannot quantify love!”This film does an excellent job capturing Imelda Marcos as both a charismatic, captivating force of nature (still! at ninety!) AND as a batshit crazy tyrant. Greenfield’s interviews with the controversial dictatorial matriarch provide shocking, probably unparalleled access into the views of a woman reflecting with pride upon half a century of corruption. For me, the most insane new understanding gleaned from Marcos’ life-story is that while we like to simplify “evil” as the act of doing wrong for the sake of self-interest, Marcos truly seems to believe that her greed and self-martyrdom and megalomania and family dynasty building is good for the Philippines and the world. And that upside-down vision of morality is far scarier than a complete lack of it. At one point in the film, Marcos declares: “perception is real, and the truth is not.” That belief is likely the single greatest threat to humanity. Holy fuck.",2020-08-06,0,0,watch,True

Flaunting her fashion, wealth, life, and motherhood makes me so goddamn angry and cringe at the same time. I just can’t believe she has this platform to talk about her nonsense.I appreciate how Lauren Greenfield, a foreigner, has been so eager to share this story so the wider world can learn about the past horrors in the Philippines under the Marcos regime, which are repeating themselves under the Duterte administration. However, this film felt neutral and detached from the harsh reality faced by the victims of the Marcos regime. Maybe it’s because it’s coming from a filmmaker who didn’t experience martial law firsthand and grew up far from the story, relying only on research.It remains too safe, and the juxtaposition of ideas doesn’t really work for this kind of topic. People in the Philippines who experienced martial law and those who grew up hearing the horrifying stories and studying the history—we know that Ferdinand Marcos is no hero, and we will never forget his evil deeds. There is only one side to the story about the Marcoses: they are monsters.

skiddoo,9,"The rise and fall of Imelda Marcos and the Marcos family, and their attempt to rise to power once more.I find Imelda's story tragic in my opinion because I honestly believe that she was a really strong and intelligent woman back in the day for having that charisma meeting and charming the strongest leaders of the world that at that time. Unfortunately, the pressure of politics took a toll on her mental state, the corrosiveness of power got into her, and Ferdinand Marcos's affairs was just the final nail on the coffin of her sanity and overall well-being.Obviously, the insanity and the narrative that she convinced herself was passed down to her children and influenced their whole family for the worse. They are so corrupt and out of touch in humanity that they are beyond salvation by any means, and should not be put in power ever again.""Ever since the new administration has come in, the Marcoses have been able to regain political clout. They have scrubbed clean the sins of the past, and they're trying to protect themselves as the leaders for the future.""— Andy Baustista(Former Chairman of Elections and PCGG)I liked that this documentary doesn't focus only on the past but also dwells on the danger of electing another Marcos in Malacañang (Presidential Palace of the Philippines). I'm just in awe at the nerve of these people trying regain political power after all the atrocity they brought to the Philippines that we are still suffering with until now.Imelda used Ferdinand Marcos as her puppet to get away from all the crimes she committed, and she is trying to attempt the same thing with her son Bong Bong Marcos by pressuring him to run for the position. Bong Bong just made it easy for her because he is desperate to get his mother's and his family's approval besides reviving their political clout and gaining power himself.Duterte revealed himself that his campaign was funded and supported by the Marcoses and his father was a cabinet member of President Marcos during his first term of candidacy. This just gives us a reason to believe that even tho Bong Bong Marcos did not win the elections, the Marcos family still has their foot on the door. One big evidence of this is that Imelda is still on the loose even though she was already found guilty of graft and corruption 2 years ago which is only one of many more examples.I really enjoyed the editing on this documentary, it really showed the true colors of the Marcoses with the supposedly ""behind the scene"" shots. A lot of infuriating moments too like when Imelda hid her painting from the PCGG and the corrupt priest calling her ""the mother of all, our only first lady."" I just wanna make puke in disgust. Kudos to the filmmakers showing those scenes at the right moments which puts the context of Imelda's wickedness on a whole different level.With all said and done, all we can do now is educate the masses, improve our educational system, put the real history in our watered down textbooks/history books, remind the people of the monstrosity that this family brought to the Philippines with anecdotes in hopes that history won't repeat itself.
