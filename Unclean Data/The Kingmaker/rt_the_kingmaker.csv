Audience,Audience,"As a Filipino, I felt the frustration after watching this. I don't know if my fellow had easily forgotten the crimes of this wicked family or we're just naturally forgiven people. In this era of fake news, this is definitely a gem with talking heads, archives footages & peer reviewed. This reminds us that we neglect the history at our risks.",Emilliano S,04/11/2023,4.0/5,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"The whole documentary film revealed how horrible and dangerous the Marcoses are. From how they got the money and power down to how they used it to rewrite history and erase the atrocities during their regime. Even those who are not into politics will realize and understand that this film is a tale of shameless corruption and blatant greed toward the Filipinos. At the present time when the possible resurgence of the Marcoses in the Philippine government, this film should be a reminder to everyone that if the Marcoses were able to abuse and lie on the face of the Filipino people in the past, there is also a big possibility that they will abuse the freedom and lie on the face of the Filipino once again. It will never be a surprise if in the future it will be proven that they maximized their machinery to get where they are today.",y8x5pmwq,05/22/2022,4.0/5,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"The documentary perfectly captured the experiences of the Marcoses and the exploited Filipinos during their regime. It shows what it is like to live with extensive wealth and how the Marcoses used it for political power and self interests. This is a must watch for those who wish to see the Marcos' perspective on Martial Law and their countless political movements. This documentary shows the truth, through direct interviews with the Marcoses, and it is up to you if you will believe it. As John Henry Newman would say: ""We can believe what we choose but we are answerable for what we choose to believe"".",Z613dLbV,05/06/2022,5.0/5,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"Weathering the storm that is Imelda Marcos is difficult, deadly even. However, Lauren Greenfield's haunting documentary The Kingmaker proves that one can dance with the devil. The film examines the lives of the Marcos clan from their rise to the Philippine government, their downfall, and their eventual return to their current political endeavors. To those unfamiliar with their name, the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos (1965 to 1986) caused some of the worst human rights violations seen in Philippine history, not to mention how the oppressive regime plunged the country's economy. While the film's title is appropriate because of its masterful storytelling, the documentary's main subjects are not worthy of this royal embellishment. Greenfield wastes no time in depicting the dichotomy between Imelda and the everyday Filipino citizen. Its first scene illustrates how emotionless she is when she hands out 50s to the beggars, proceeding to call their area ""depressing"" after reflecting on her loss of power. This opening scene already sets Imelda as someone immaculate, a savior or—in her words—a ""mother"" to those who are in need of her love. But as the film proceeds, we see how the Marcoses were never the loving parents every child wanted; their names continue haunt the people who were tortured and killed during Martial Law. The Kingmaker beautifully interpolates many sides of those who lived during and beyond the Marcos dictatorship. It is this multisectoral approach that helps audiences understand how grave the consequences of Martial Law really are. From Imelda's friends to opposition figures and Martial Law victims and activists, no stone is left unturned in dissecting how Imelda's brain works. What took the cake for me was how these figures were visited a few years after. For example, Vice President Leni Robredo and activist May Rodriguez' thoughts regarding Bongbong Marcos' vice presidential run were cut into two—the time leading up to the 2016 elections and the aftermath of Robredo's win. This follow up emphasizes how the Marcoses' dirt will never be erased from history, despite their numerous attempts to do so. It feels like the country hasn't moved much in terms of progression. What's more haunting is that all the imagery of Marcos running feels familiar, scarily real even. Now that Marcos is vouching for President, it is deeply concerning how far their influence can go. This is what exactly The Kingmaker aims to address: to expose the shoes and skeletons of the Marcos family's closets and to remind Filipinos of their oppressive rule. It demonstrates how far one will go to sustain their wealth, power, and image. Time will tell when the Marcos magic will finally disappear from the country. But for now, let this film be a reminder to never forget the many lives that suffered under their brutal rule.",y3wP7Wev,05/05/2022,5.0/5,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"The epilogue part is not biased. it is a Great movie! Every great movie, regardless of its genre and while this is a documentary, will leave you questioning. This movie have broadened my knowledge and left my heart stirred. just to give a little weigh to balance the majority of the reviews that has been shared above, I can say, the the epilogue really left me cluless about the later. It help me become more aware about the history of the Philippine politics. Probably, I will be seeing myself watching this documentary again. Why? I want to feel the tension in the converse between the statements of the characters choosen to be interviewed. Who ever is reading this, I challenge you try watching it again.",rwj7dwvb,03/16/2022,5.0/5,all-audience
Audience,Audience,"This should be mandatory viewing for High School students as part of Philippine History. And a long test as part of your grades, plus an essay. The Marcoses want to take back Malacanang Palace to rule the country once again. The disinformation campaign rewriting and white-washing the Martial Law era should be exposed and examined in detail.
